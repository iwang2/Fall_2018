## Math Review

### Dot Product
Transposing one vector onto another.
```
v1 = [ a ]  v2 = [ c ]    v1 • v2 = ac + bd
     [ b ]       [ d ]
```
If two vectors are orthogonal, their dot product is 0.

### Matrix Multiplication
You probably remember this.
- Not commutative, `A • B` is not always the same as `B • A`
- However, it is associative `(A • B) • C` = `A • (B • C)`

## 2D Transformations

### Translate
Use translation vector instead of adding to x and y separately

```
x' = x + dx      P = [ x ]  T = [ dx ]     P' = P + T
y' = y + dy          [ y ]      [ dy ]
```

### Scale
If not centered at the origin, does not scale in place.
```
x' = x * sx      P = [ x ]  S = [ sx  0 ]  P' = S ⋅ P
y' = y * sy          [ y ]      [ 0  sy ]
```

### Rotate
Occurs by default around the origin
```
θ = angle of rotation      R = [ cosθ -sinθ ]
x' = x cosθ - y sinθ           [ sinθ  cosθ]
y' = x sinθ + y cosθ       P' = R • P
```

### Homogeneous Coordinates
Scaling and rotating occur by matrix multiplication, so we try to do the same with translations.

```
    | x |        | sx 0  0 |           | x * sx |
P = | y |    S = | 0  sy 0 |   S • P = | y * sy |
    | 1 |        | 0  0  1 |           |   1    |

                 | c -s  0 |           | x cosθ - y sinθ | 
             R = | s  c  0 |   R • P = | x sinθ + y cosθ |
                 | 0  0  1 |           |        1        |

                 | 1  0 dx |          | x + dx |
             T = | 0  1 dy |  T • P = | y + dy |
                 | 0  0  1 |          |   1    |
```

The so-called "no-op" matrix is the identity matrix.
```
    | 1  0  0 |
I = | 0  1  0 |
    | 0  0  1 |
```

### Shear
shifting the top (or side) of a shape
```
x-shear:       SHx = | 1  a  0 |
x' = x + ay          | 0  1  0 |
y' = y               | 0  0  1 |
```

### Reflection
```
x-reflection:          | -1  0  0 |         | 1  0  0 |
x' = -x          RFx = |  0  1  0 |   RFy = | 0 -1  0 |
y' = y                 |  0  0  1 |         | 0  0  1 |
```
