# Linear Algebra

gonna fail this test!!!

Word | Definition
--- | ---
consistent | system has a solution
inconsistent | system does not have a solution
elementary row operation | 3 basic operations (replace, interchange, scale)
row equivalent | there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other
basic variable | not a free variable (correspond to pivot columns)
parametric description | solution sets where the free variables are parameters
span | all possibilities that can be formed by a linear combination of the given vectors
homogenous | system that can be written as `Ax = 0` (nontrivially, if there is a free variable)
linear independence | set of vectors with only the trivial solution (no free variables)
linear dependence | set of vectors with a nontrivial solution / free variables / at least one vector is a linear combination of the others
linear transformation | *T*(c**u** + d**v**) =  c*T*(**u**) + d*T*(**v**)
onto | for each b, Ax = b is consistent (pivot position in every row)
one-to-one | each solution is mapped onto by at most one x (no free variables, linearly independent columns)
singular matrix | not invertible
nonsingular matrix | invertible
elementary matrix | identity matrix with single elementary row operation performed
subspace | contains the zero vector, and is closed under addition and scalar multiplication
column space | span of the columns of a matrix
null space | set of all solutions to the homogenous equation
basis | linearly independent set that spans the subspace
standard basis | formed by the identity matrix
coordinate vector of x | set of weights that transforms a basis into x
dimension | number of vectors in a basis
rank | dimension of the column space
probability vector | nonnegative entries that add to 1
stochastic matrix | square matrix with probability vector columns
steady state vector | Pq = q
regular matrix | contains only positive entries
similar matrices | same characteristic equation and eigenvalues
diagonalizable matrix | has enough linearly independent eigenvectors for form a basis
length of a vector | normalization (square root of the squares)
orthogonal | dot product is equal to 0
QR factorization | must have linearly independent columns
