## Assembly
Pseudo-ops | Definition
--- | ---
`.orig` | where to put the data to be assembled
`.fill` | intialize one location
`.blkw n` | set aside `n` words in memory; this is used for allocating arrays
`.stringz "sample"` | initialize 7 locations ("sample" + 0 word)
`.end` | end of assembly program

## LC3
General Operation | Definition
--- | ---
LOAD (LD) | load from memory into a register
STORE (ST) | store from a register into memory

Operation | Symbol | Inputs | What it does
--- | --- | --- | ---
LOAD | LD | R, PCoffset9 | EA = PC + offset<br>R = M[EA]
LOAD indirect | LDI | R, PCoffset9 | EA = PC + offset<br>R = M[M[EA]]<br>takes at least 6 clock cycles
STORE indirect | STI | R, PCoffset9 | EA = PC + offset<br> M[M[EA]] = R
LOAD effective address | LEA | R, PCoffset9 | EA = PC + offset<br>R = EA

## Digital Logic
**open** switch - current *cannot* go through  
**closed** switch - current *can* go through

relays -> vacuum tube (diode) -> transistor (electronic switch)

### Complementary Transistors
- n-type MOS - normally open (off)
- p-type MOS (circle) - normally closed (on)
