**Psychological science**: 

Noncritical thinking leads to erroneous conclusions.

### Major Themes in Psychology
1. Nature vs. nurture (born with or acquired) -> **now** recognized that its **both**
2. Mind/body - relation of mental and physical

## Research Methods
Valid scientific research consists of carefully used methodology, verifiable results, and public disclosure.

### Descriptive Methods
1. naturalistic and participant observation
2. surveys
3. case studies

There are also developmental, experimental, and biopsychological methods. 

### Naturalistic Observation
- Jane Goodall (Chimpanzees)
- Dian Fossey (Gorillas)
- Mary Ainsworth (infant bonding) - observing children when their mothers are in and out of the room
- Albert Bandura (social learning) - children repeat the actions of adults

### Participant Observation
Researcher engages as well as observes what is occuring in the activity. This is difficult because the researcher must become integrates into the environment while also taking objective notes.

### Surveys
- polls (opinion, political)
- marketing surveys

These are self reported, so they can lack validity. Responses can vary greatly depending on the wording of the questions.
- Avoid "leading" or "negative" qeustions
- avoid encouraging social desirability
- avoid "double-barreled" questions

### Case Study
- Oliver Sacks
- Alexander Luria - "S" (Solomon Shereschevsky) had amazing memory

Brenda Milner - "H.M" (Henry Molaison) **hippocampus** removed to get rid of seizures, and then could not learn anything new  
This brings the distinction between short and long term memory. H.M. still had short term memory, but did not have episodic memory.  
She also studied his procedural memory using the mirror test. He was getting better at the task, but could not ever remember doing it.

Phineas Gage: probably the most famous case study  
- blasting accident ran a rod through his right cheek and through the top of his skull (got up and walked away)

### Correlational Studies
A correlation shows a *relationship* but does **not** imply *causation*.

**Correlation Coefficient** - measure of association between variables (-1.0 to +1.0)  
The strength of the coefficient determines predictive validity. 

### Quasi-Experimental Methods
In between descriptive and experimental.

#### Developmental Methods
Cross-sectional design - subjects cannot be randomly assigned (most commonly used in aging studies)

### Research Ethics
Institutional Research Board - different levels of review to approve of experiments
- informed consent
- avoid deception
- no extreme inducements to participate
- must have debriefing after study
- insure confidentiality
- no harm
