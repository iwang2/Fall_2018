## Who Studies Psychology?

Noncritical thinking leads to erroneous conclusions.

### Major Themes in Psychology
1. Nature vs. nurture (born with or acquired) -> **now** recognized that its **both**
2. Mind/body - relation of mental and physical 

**Psychology:** both natural and social science
- **natural** - concerned with laws of nature
- **social** - thoughts, feelings , and social behaviors of organisms

---
## Research Methods
Valid scientific research consists of carefully used methodology, verifiable results, and public disclosure.
1. descriptive
2. developmental (within and between-subject)
3. experimental

### Descriptive Methods
1. naturalistic and participant observation
2. surveys
3. case studies

There are also developmental, experimental, and biopsychological methods. 

### Naturalistic Observation
- Jane Goodall (Chimpanzees)
- Dian Fossey (Gorillas)
- Mary Ainsworth (infant bonding) - observing children when their mothers are in and out of the room
- Albert Bandura (social learning) - children repeat the actions of adults

### Participant Observation
Researcher engages as well as observes what is occuring in the activity. This is difficult because the researcher must become integrates into the environment while also taking objective notes.

### Surveys
- polls (opinion, political)
- marketing surveys

These are self reported, so they can lack validity. Responses can vary greatly depending on the wording of the questions.
- Avoid "leading" or "negative" qeustions
- avoid encouraging social desirability
- avoid "double-barreled" questions

### Case Study
- Oliver Sacks
- Alexander Luria - "S" (Solomon Shereschevsky) had amazing memory

Brenda Milner - "H.M" (Henry Molaison) **hippocampus** removed to get rid of seizures, and then could not learn anything new  
This brings the distinction between short and long term memory. H.M. still had short term memory, but did not have episodic memory.  
She also studied his procedural memory using the mirror test. He was getting better at the task, but could not ever remember doing it.

Phineas Gage: probably the most famous case study  
- blasting accident ran a rod through his right cheek and through the top of his skull (got up and walked away)

### Correlational Studies
A correlation shows a *relationship* but does **not** imply *causation*.

**Correlation Coefficient** - measure of association between variables (-1.0 to +1.0)  
The strength of the coefficient determines predictive validity. 

### Quasi-Experimental Methods
In between descriptive and experimental.

#### Developmental Methods
Cross-sectional design - subjects cannot be randomly assigned (most commonly used in aging studies)

### Research Ethics
Institutional Research Board - different levels of review to approve of experiments
- informed consent
- avoid deception
- no extreme inducements to participate
- must have debriefing after study
- insure confidentiality
- no harm

---
## Experimental Methods
Control all variables except the one being manipulated (independent variable), and measure the dependent variable.  
In psychology, DV is usually a behavior. 

- **experimental method**: randomly assign participants
- **quasi-experimental**: 

A theory can be tested and is falsifiable. 

### The Experimental Method
rationale (theory, problem, observation) -> hypothesis -> empirical study -> measure and data analysis (is difference in DV due to chance; p < 0.5?) -> interpretation and conclusions

**Theory** - explanation using set of principles organizing observations / predicts behaviors or events  
**Hypothesis** - single, testable prediction  
**Null Hypothesis** - no difference between conditions (Cannot be fully proven)  
**Operational Definition** - precise description of procedures to define research variables (may be hypothetical constructs, like memory)

### Variables
- **independent** - manipulated; typically a stimulus variable
- **dependent** - measured; typically a response variable
- **confounding** - another varying with IV and affecting DV because of lack of control (third variable problem)

### Confounding Variables
Dr. Sandler associated polio and ice cream consumption, assumed sugar consumption increases prevalence of polio.
However, it is warm weather that makes the polio virus more active.

### Other Things
- **hypothetical construct** - 
- **operational defintion** - explains how variable will be affected

### Measures of Central Tendency 
- mode (most common), median, mean

### Measures of Variability
- range
- variance (average of squared deviations) (sum of all the (score - mean)<sup>2</sup> / n-1 )
- standard deviation (square root of variance)

### Inferential Statistics
- means and variance ban be used to determine whether a difference is significant 
- generalization from samples to population
- describes change of event occuring as

### Standard Score (Z score)
normal distribution - > convert to distribution based on standard deviations with mean of 0 and SD of 1

### Characteristics of Scientific Research
- verifiable and valid (accurate prediction)
- publicized (must be peer reviewed)
- scientific findings are cumulative (built on past research)

### 1. Biopsychology
Vincent Dethier - feeding behavior in the housefly
1. observation - fly walks on the food while eating
2. hypothesis - fly tastes with its feet
3. manipulation - whether head/feet in sugar
4. measure proboscis
5. conclusion - fly tastes with its feet

### 2. Social
Bibb Latane and John Darley - The Bystander Effect  
The more people there are, the less chance
- Kitty Genovesse Case, Seizure Experiment

### 3. Cognitive
Aging and Memory - episodic memory most affected, but semantic cues will improve that

## Biopsychology and Neuroscience
Control the behavior and mind.
- CNS(central nervous system), PNS (peripheral nervous system), endocrine, genetics

### Nervous System
#### CNS
- brain, spinal cord
#### PNS
Everything else branching out from the brain and spinal cord.
- **semantic NS**
  - skin/muscles/joints send signals to CNS- sensory/afferent neurons
  - CNS sends isngals to muscles/joints/skin - *motor/efferent* neurons
- **autonomic NS**
  - glands/internal organs -> CNS
  - CNS - > glands/internal organs

### Autonomic Nervous System
Fight or flight response (tend and befriend for women, controversial)
#### Spinal Reflex
- patellar reflex - hitting the knee
- infant reflexes - grasp, moro, step, rooting, babinski

### The Neuron
Information processing between neurons is electrical and electro-chemical.
- **schwann cells** - myelin sheaths around the axon (speed up transmission)
- **nodes of Ranvier** - gaps in the myelin sheaths, which allow for saltatory conduction
- **dendrites** - collect input from terminal buttons of presynaptic cells; if interpreted info reaches a threshold, the cell fires
**Glial** cells support neurons, help maintain environment and produce myelin.
- resting and action potential - threshold is "all or none" for transmission

### Synapse
Gap between dendrites and terminal button of two different cells

neurotransmitters made in the axon -> stroed in vesicles -> fuse to the membrane after action potential and released into synaptic cleft -> neurotransmission terminated -> bind to postsynaptic receptors 

many differnet neurotransmitters, may *excite* or *inhibit* cell potential
- **agonist** - increases action
- **antagonist**  - decreases

#### Alcohol
An *agonist* for GABA, serotonin, and dopamine.

### The Brain (Cerebral Cortex)
- **central fissure** - somatosensory and motor humunculus

### Face Recognition
Fusiform face area.

- **Wernicke's aphasia** - cannot speak in cohernt sentences and understanding speech(don't know they are not making sense)  
- **Broca's aphasia** - language production

### The Limbic System
hypothalamus (motivation), thalamus (sensory neurons, except olfaction), hippocampus (memory formation) , amygdala (emotion regulation)

### Biopsychology Methods
- human brain-lesion case studies (Montreal procedure - Wilder Penfield)
- stereotaxic method (precise lesion/stimulation)
- electrophysiology (EEG) - high temporal resolution, low spatial resolution (many layers to go through)
- neuroimaging - low temporal resolution, high spatial resolution
  - positron emission tomography (PET)
  - MRI
- transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS)

### PET imaging
- metabolic processes in the body

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
- no radiation or x-rays, less invasive
- uses strong magnetic fields to generate images of the organs
- structural looks at anatomy
- function looks at activity (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent)

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
- also non-invasive; changing magnetic field causes electric current to flow in targeted region via electromagnetic induction
- used as treatment for depression

---
### Endocrine System
Collection of glands that erlease hormones into the bloodstream to regulate physiology and behavior.
- include hypothalamus in the brain; releases a hormone that regulates other glands through the pituitary gland
- the rest are targeted to other organs through blood circulation

### Behavioral Genetics
- Half and half from parents
- **genotype** - genetic composition determined at conception
- **phenotype** - observable characteristics determined by dominant genes and environment
- **heritability** - variance attributed to genetics; significant in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's Disease, fluid intelligence

### Twin Studies
- share a trait, they are condordant
- if only one has a trait, they are discordant
- rate of concordane in monozygotic twwins is an indicater of heritability
- high cross-cultural reliability in concordance rates

## Child Development
Number | Stage
--- | ---
1 | [Prenatal](#prenatal-development)
2 | [Perceptual](#perceptual-development)
3 | [Physical and Motor](#physical-and-motor-development)
4 | [Cognitive](#cognitive-development)
5 | [Social](#social-development)
6 | [Moral](#moral-development)

### Prenatal development
1. **germinal stage** (2 weeks after conception) - division of fertilized zygote
2. **embryonic stage** (2 - 8 weeks) - differentiation into body parts
3. **fetal stage** (9 weeks - birth) - body systems develop; brain cells become myelinated

Human brains undergo much more development than chimp brains.  
Fetal environment subject to mother's nutrition.
- *thalidomide* - over the counter drug to treat morning sickness; children born with phocomelia

### Perceptual Development
- fetus cannot see, but can hear (most developed of all senses at birth); prefers mother's voice
- near-sighted 
- track social stimula (will track a face longer)
- mimic facial expressions

### Physical and Motor Development
- newborns have motor reflexes that mostly disappear after a few months
- **cephalocaudal rule** - head to toe development
- **proximodistal rule** - "inside-out" center of the body to periphery

### Cognitive Development
Up to adulthood, children need to understand 3 things:
1. how the physical world works
2. how their mind represents the world
3. how other minds represent the world

They learn to think by developing schemas:
1. **assimilation** - apply existing schemas in novel situations
2. **accommodation** - revises schema based on new information

Piaget developed this theory by watching his own kids. Believed that development occurs in stages:
1. **sensorimotor** (birth -2 yrs)
   - using senses and ability to move
   - develops understanding by coordinating the two
   - acting intentionally (not reflex)
2. **preoperational** (2-6y yrs) - language
   - using words and images; symbolic thinking rather than just connections
   - stage thinking egocentrically (what I see is what you see), basic understanding of other minds
3. **concrete operational** (6-11 yrs)
4. **formal operational** (11+) - can think logically, hypothetically, concerned with the future

Deveopment is not step-like, but a gradual transition. Piaget ignored differences in cognitive style and culture.

### Social Development
- attachment - bond between child and caregiver
- orphanages - children were warm and well fed, but many were physically and psychologically impaired
- **contact comfort** - important factor, more so than food (sense of security); the instinct for touch with something soft
- **imprinting** - attachment to first moving thing (Konrad Lorenz - ducks)

Human infants engage in behavior to keep their mother close.   
Mary Ainsworth - **strange situation test** attachment styles
- 60% secure, 20% avoidant, 15% ambivalent, 5% no attachment style at all

### Moral Development
- Piaget - moves from realism to relativism, prescriptions to principles
#### Kohlberg's theory 
- **preconventional** - morality is determined by consequences 
- **conventional** - determined by
- **postconventional** - determined by self

## Adolescence and (to) Adulthood
Lots of research on children, but little after age 12. 
- Erik Erickson - one of few to look at development throughout life
- trained psychoanalyst

### Erickson's Psychosocial Stages
Believed more in psychosocial than Freud's psychosexual. 

\# | Stage | Age | Crisis
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Infancy | 0-2 | trust vs. mistrust
2 | Toddler | 2-3 | autonomy vs. shame and doubt (sense of free will)
3 | Preschool | 4-6 | initiative vs. guilt 
4 | Childhood | 6-12 | industry vs. inferiority (comparison to others)
5 | Adolescence | 13-19 | identity vs. role confusion (sense of self)
6 | Young adulthood | 20s | intimacy cs. isolation (love)
7 | Middle adulthood | 30s-50s | generatity vs. stagnation
8 | Old age | 60+ | ego integrity vs. despair (acceptance)

### Adolescence
From 11-13 to 18-21
- Begings with puberty (varies greatly) and ends with adulthood
- on average, gain 40 lbs. and grow 10 in.
- in USA, in 1900s puberty for girls began from 16-17, now at age 13
- The period of adolescence is widening.
- inner turmoil and increased recklessness (more suceptible to peer influence

### Brain Development
The prefrontal cortex finishes development last (20s-30s). Thus, adolescents rely more on the amygdala (emotional center of the brain).

### Sexuality
More psychological distress amongst girls who get their period early.

### Adulthood
- Changes in cognition around 25 years of age (reduced episodic memory and speed, but compensated by experience). 
- changes in brain (less specialized)
  - less hemispheric asymmetry
  - neuroplasticity of abilities and brain location
  
### Intelligence
- **fluid** (analytic reasoning) - decreases with age
- **crystallized** - increases with age

### Marital Satisfaction
Tends to decrease with age.

### Aging
**Socio-emotional Selctivity Theory** - Cartensen - When we're younger, we interact with people for information. When we're older, we seek more emotional stability, selecting relationships and investing in activities that provide emotional satisfaction. 

- older adults do not seek new relationships, and experience lower levels of stress, anger, and worry
- younger adults overestimate problems of old age
- sensory, cognitive loss, seeking emotional selectivity theory
- no evidence for mid-life crisis
- Alzheimer's Disease is age-related, but a disease (only 29% of people over 80)

## Sensation and the Senses
- **sensation** - *detection* of an environmental stimulus
- **perception** - *interpretation* of an environmental stimulus

stimulus -> sensory receptors (Transduction - turned to neural signals) -> travels to brain via synapses (information processing) -> cortex (full perception)

### Transduction
Type | Stimulus | Action Potential Location
--- | --- | ---
vision | light in eye | optic nerve
audition | sound in inner ear | auditory nerve
smell | chemical molecules in air (nose) | olfactory bulb
taste | chemical molecules in food (mouth) | taste buds
touch | pressure on skin | cells under skin
balance | gravity and motion in inner ear (position of muscles) | vestibular senses and feedback from muscles

### Receptor Location
Sense | Location
--- | ---
vision | retina in eye
audition | cochlea in inner ear
smell | olfactory bulb in nose
taste | taste buds on tongue and mouth
touch | just under skin
temperature | under skin
pain | under skin
kinesthesis | muscles and joints
vestibular senses | inner ear

### Chemical Senses
Sense of taste and smell. 

### Vestibular Senses
- Cortex and cerebellum receive info from vestibular sense and from kinesthetic senses in muscles to maintain stability and balance.
- sensation is unconscious

### Cortical PRojection Areas
Sense | Projection Area
--- | ---
vision | occipital cortex
audition | temporal
smell | frontal/temporal
taste | parietal
touch | somatosensory (parietal)
proprioception | cerebellum and somatosensory

---
## Visual Perception
Perception is the cognitive interpretation of the environmental stimulus, once detected.  
This is affected by not just familiarity with the stimulus, but
- principles of organization
- context

### Principles of Organization
Figure-ground relationships.

#### Gestalt
Ways we organize what we see.
a. proximity
b. similarity 
c. continuity 
d. closure
e. common region
f. connectedness

Often used in graphic design.

### Context
Depending on the surroundings of an object, things can appear differently.
- **Muller Lyer illusion** - line lengths
- **Shephard's table top illusion** - two tables look to be different sizes
- **Ames room** - assumption that walls are parallel
- **Mach Bands** - contrast due to visual information processing; step gradient
- **Hermann Grid Illusion** - grey dots at intersections of a grid

### Perception of Depth
Some of it is biological, some is learned.  
Processed by the parietal lobe. 

#### Gibson and Walk
Visual Cliff Experiment
- 6-14 months - all children crossed over to mom at shallow end, but refused to cross to deep end
- turtles and chickens would cross
- lambs and kittens would not

#### Primary Depth Cues (Biological)
- **accomodation** - lens stretching
- **convergence** - muscle tension in two eyes
- **retinal disparity** - two different visual representations sent to our brains (left and right eye)

#### Secondary Depth Cues (Learned)
Monocular (relies on sight from only one eye).
- overlap (interpostion or occulusion)
- size perspective - judgement from distances
- linear perspective
- shading and shadows (things like atmospheric effects)
- relative motion - objects closer to you move faster, objects farther away are slower 
- texture gradient - as things get farther away,
