**Psychological science**: 

Noncritical thinking leads to erroneous conclusions.

### Major Themes in Psychology
1. Nature vs. nurture (born with or acquired) -> **now** recognized that its **both**
2. Mind/body - relation of mental and physical 

**Psychology:** both natural and social science
- **natural** - concerned with laws of nature
- **social** - thoughts, feelings , and social behaviors of organisms

## Research Methods
Valid scientific research consists of carefully used methodology, verifiable results, and public disclosure.
1. descriptive
2. developmental (within and between-subject)
3. experimental

### Descriptive Methods
1. naturalistic and participant observation
2. surveys
3. case studies

There are also developmental, experimental, and biopsychological methods. 

### Naturalistic Observation
- Jane Goodall (Chimpanzees)
- Dian Fossey (Gorillas)
- Mary Ainsworth (infant bonding) - observing children when their mothers are in and out of the room
- Albert Bandura (social learning) - children repeat the actions of adults

### Participant Observation
Researcher engages as well as observes what is occuring in the activity. This is difficult because the researcher must become integrates into the environment while also taking objective notes.

### Surveys
- polls (opinion, political)
- marketing surveys

These are self reported, so they can lack validity. Responses can vary greatly depending on the wording of the questions.
- Avoid "leading" or "negative" qeustions
- avoid encouraging social desirability
- avoid "double-barreled" questions

### Case Study
- Oliver Sacks
- Alexander Luria - "S" (Solomon Shereschevsky) had amazing memory

Brenda Milner - "H.M" (Henry Molaison) **hippocampus** removed to get rid of seizures, and then could not learn anything new  
This brings the distinction between short and long term memory. H.M. still had short term memory, but did not have episodic memory.  
She also studied his procedural memory using the mirror test. He was getting better at the task, but could not ever remember doing it.

Phineas Gage: probably the most famous case study  
- blasting accident ran a rod through his right cheek and through the top of his skull (got up and walked away)

### Correlational Studies
A correlation shows a *relationship* but does **not** imply *causation*.

**Correlation Coefficient** - measure of association between variables (-1.0 to +1.0)  
The strength of the coefficient determines predictive validity. 

### Quasi-Experimental Methods
In between descriptive and experimental.

#### Developmental Methods
Cross-sectional design - subjects cannot be randomly assigned (most commonly used in aging studies)

### Research Ethics
Institutional Research Board - different levels of review to approve of experiments
- informed consent
- avoid deception
- no extreme inducements to participate
- must have debriefing after study
- insure confidentiality
- no harm

## Experimental Methods
Control all variables except the one being manipulated (independent variable), and measure the dependent variable.  
In psychology, DV is usually a behavior. 

- **experimental method**: randomly assign participants
- **quasi-experimental**: 

A theory can be tested and is falsifiable. 

### The Experimental Method
rationale (theory, problem, observation) -> hypothesis -> empirical study -> measure and data analysis (is difference in DV due to chance; p < 0.5?) -> interpretation and conclusions

**Theory** - explanation using set of principles organizing observations / predicts behaviors or events  
**Hypothesis** - single, testable prediction  
**Null Hypothesis** - no difference between conditions (Cannot be fully proven)  
**Operational Definition** - precise description of procedures to define research variables (may be hypothetical constructs, like memory)

### Variables
- **independent** - manipulated; typically a stimulus variable
- **dependent** - measured; typically a response variable
- **confounding** - another varying with IV and affecting DV because of lack of control (third variable problem)

### Confounding Variables
Dr. Sandler associated polio and ice cream consumption, assumed sugar consumption increases prevalence of polio.
However, it is warm weather that makes the polio virus more active.

### Other Things
- **hypothetical construct** - 
- **operational defintion** - explains how variable will be affected

### Measures of Central Tendency 
- mode (most common), median, mean

### Measures of Variability
- range
- variance (average of squared deviations) (sum of all the (score - mean)<sup>2</sup> / n-1 )
- standard deviation (square root of variance)

### Inferential Statistics
- means and variance ban be used to determine whether a difference is significant 
- generalization from samples to population
- describes change of event occuring as

### Standard Score (Z score)
normal distribution - > convert to distribution based on standard deviations with mean of 0 and SD of 1

### Characteristics of Scientific Research
- verifiable and valid (accurate prediction)
- publicized (must be peer reviewed)
- scientific findings are cumulative (built on past research)

### 1. Biopsychology
Vincent Dethier - feeding behavior in the housefly
1. observation - fly walks on the food while eating
2. hypothesis - fly tastes with its feet
3. manipulation - whether head/feet in sugar
4. measure proboscis
5. conclusion - fly tastes with its feet

### 2. Social
Bibb Latane and John Darley - The Bystander Effect  
The more people there are, the less chance
- Kitty Genovesse Case, Seizure Experiment

### 3. Cognitive
Aging and Memory - episodic memory most affected, but semantic cues will improve that
