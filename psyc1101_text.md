# Methods
### Rationalism
Used until mid-19th century.  
View that reason and logical argument to answer questions about how the mind works, rather than experience.  
Aristotle, for example, said the heart was the origin of all emotion (center of the body), and the brain served to cool blood. Hence, terms like kindhearted, heartless, etc.

## Descriptive Methods
Means to capture/record/describe a group. Identification without understanding the "why."

## Naturalistic Observation
No attempt to manipulate/control conditions.  
Produces **ecologically valid** observations of genuine reactions. 

**Hawthorne effect** - people reactively change their behavior once they are aware are being observed

### Disadvantages
- lack of control of the environment
- uncertainty of factors affecting behavior
- difficult for other researches to repeat experiment

## Participant Observation
Researcher becomes a part of the group under investigation.
- can provide greater access to daily life/activities
- may also increase bias
