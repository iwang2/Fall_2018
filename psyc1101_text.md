# Methods
### Rationalism
Used until mid-19th century.  
View that reason and logical argument to answer questions about how the mind works, rather than experience.  
Aristotle, for example, said the heart was the origin of all emotion (center of the body), and the brain served to cool blood. Hence, terms like kindhearted, heartless, etc.

## Descriptive Methods
Means to capture/record/describe a group. Identification without understanding the "why."

## Naturalistic Observation
No attempt to manipulate/control conditions.  
Produces **ecologically valid** observations of genuine reactions. 

**Hawthorne effect** - people reactively change their behavior once they are aware are being observed

### Disadvantages
- lack of control of the environment
- uncertainty of factors affecting behavior
- difficult for other researches to repeat experiment

Researchers should share results to ensure **interrater reliability**, as two observers may take away different observations from the same event.

## Participant Observation
Researcher becomes a part of the group under investigation.
- can provide greater access to daily life/activities
- may also increase bias

### David Rosenhan (Stanford prof.)
Skeptical of diagnostic abilities of clinicians.  
- used participant observation by sending researchers to fake being insane -> physicians operated with a strong bias toward a false positive

## Case Studies
In-depth analysis of unique circumstance/individual. Popular in medicine, where clinicians will observe an unusual patient.
- For example, H.M. had his hippocampus removed to treat his seizures, but made it so that he could no longer form new memories. This leads to the identification of different types of memories (episodic, semantic, procedural).

The conclusions drawn from case studies can never be broadly generalized because it is only focused on one subject. 

## Surveys
Quick way of collecting lots of information.
- **sample** - smaller subset of the broader population
- **sampling error/bias** - pooled selection of people that differs from the entire population in meaningful ways

### Disadvantages
- **wording effects** - incorporating stronger words will change people's answers, even if the question would essentially be asking the same thing
- **aquiescent response bias** - indiscriminately "agreeing" with items on a survey
- **socially desireable bias** - responding in a way that is seen as acceptable by others 
- **illusory superiority** - tendency to describe our own behavior as better than average
- **volunteer bias** - people who are willing to answer uncomfortable survey questions are overrepresented

## Research Ethics
Standards of behavior; principles that outline how people should be educated, treated, and respected when participating in a study.
a. Beneficence and Nonmaleficence - striving to do good and avoiding experiments that can intentionally harm participants
b. Fidelity and Responsibility - be honest and reliable
c. Integrity - accurate, honest, non-biased practices
d. Justice - researchers should not include/exclude any group from particpation for reasons unrelated to the study
e. Respect for People's Rights and Dignity - open and honest communication about study details, respect of privacy, etc.
