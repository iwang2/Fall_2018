# Methods
### Rationalism
Used until mid-19th century.  
View that reason and logical argument to answer questions about how the mind works, rather than experience.  
Aristotle, for example, said the heart was the origin of all emotion (center of the body), and the brain served to cool blood. Hence, terms like kindhearted, heartless, etc.

## Descriptive Methods
Means to capture/record/describe a group. Identification without understanding the "why."

## Naturalistic Observation
No attempt to manipulate/control conditions.  
Produces **ecologically valid** observations of genuine reactions. 

**Hawthorne effect** - people reactively change their behavior once they are aware are being observed

### Disadvantages
- lack of control of the environment
- uncertainty of factors affecting behavior
- difficult for other researches to repeat experiment

Researchers should share results to ensure **interrater reliability**, as two observers may take away different observations from the same event.

## Participant Observation
Researcher becomes a part of the group under investigation.
- can provide greater access to daily life/activities
- may also increase bias

### David Rosenhan (Stanford prof.)
Skeptical of diagnostic abilities of clinicians.  
- used participant observation by sending researchers to fake being insane -> physicians operated with a strong bias toward a false positive

## Case Studies
In-depth analysis of unique circumstance/individual. Popular in medicine, where clinicians will observe an unusual patient.
- For example, H.M. had his hippocampus removed to treat his seizures, but made it so that he could no longer form new memories. This leads to the identification of different types of memories (episodic, semantic, procedural).

The conclusions drawn from case studies can never be broadly generalized because it is only focused on one subject. 

## Surveys
Quick way of collecting lots of information.
- **sample** - smaller subset of the broader population
- **sampling error/bias** - pooled selection of people that differs from the entire population in meaningful ways

### Disadvantages
- **wording effects** - incorporating stronger words will change people's answers, even if the question would essentially be asking the same thing
- **aquiescent response bias** - indiscriminately "agreeing" with items on a survey
- **socially desireable bias** - responding in a way that is seen as acceptable by others 
- **illusory superiority** - tendency to describe our own behavior as better than average
- **volunteer bias** - people who are willing to answer uncomfortable survey questions are overrepresented

## Research Ethics
Standards of behavior; principles that outline how people should be educated, treated, and respected when participating in a study.  
a. Beneficence and Nonmaleficence - striving to do good and avoiding experiments that can intentionally harm participants
b. Fidelity and Responsibility - be honest and reliable
c. Integrity - accurate, honest, non-biased practices
d. Justice - researchers should not include/exclude any group from particpation for reasons unrelated to the study
e. Respect for People's Rights and Dignity - open and honest communication about study details, respect of privacy, etc.

### Internal Review Board
Committee of independent people who review and assess if the research project complies with the General Ethical principles.
- sound research design
- risks of participation are minimized and reasonable
- benefits of outweigh potential risks
- participants can make an informed decision to participate and may withdraw at any time without consequence
- safeguards are in place to protect participants
- collected data will be kept private and confidential

**informed consent:** researchers work with participants to describe essential details (procedures, risks/benefits, protection of personal info, participant rights)

### Special Ethical Considerations
Vulnerable populations include people with:
1. **Decisional impairment** - diminished capacity to provide informed consent (children, mentally disabled)
   - consent to participate requires informed consent by the parents and guardians, and **assent** from the participant
2. **Situational Vulnerability** - freedom of choice is compromised as a result of undue influence from another source (military personnel, prisoners)
   - additional safeguards must exist to prevent exploitation (impartial third-party to advocate on behalf of individuals)
   
### Deception
Researchers must receive IRB approval:
1. no more than a minimal risk to participants (emotional/physical discomfort)
2. does not affect the wellbeing and rights of participants
3. justification that deception is the only way to conduct the study
4. participants must be **debriefed** afterwards 

**confederate** - researcher acting like a participant

Stanly Milgram's Conformity Experiment - lack of consideration for maleficence and failure to respect people's rights and dignity

## Correlation
Used to capture the direction and strength of a relationship between variables.

### Correlation Coefficient
To numerically represent the strength of the relationship (from -1 to +1)

### Misleading
Correlation does not automatically imply cause and effect relationships.
- **confounding variable** - other variables may influence what is being measured
- **causality** - notion that one variable directly affects another variable

## Experimental Methods
### Hypothesis
Prediction about what will happen in research, and used to directly link ideas within a **cause and effect** relationship.  
Hypotheses myst be consistent with prior observations/exsiting theory, simple as possible, specific, testable, and falsifiable.

**extraneous (confounding) variables** - not the focus of the study, but may influence the outcome of research if not controlled

### Sample Selection
- **simple random** - every individual has an equal chance of participatin
- **stratified random** - divides the population by subgroups, then random samples are taken in proportion to the population of interest
- **non-random** - not all individuals are equally likely to participate
  - **convenience sample** - group of individuals selected only bc of a pre-existing condition, convenience, easy access

### Validity
- **internal** - controlling for factors that might bias the outcome of an experiment
- **external** - relevance and whether the conclusion can be generalized

## Making Sense of Data
### Central Tendency (Describing)
Score that best represents the others (mean is typical)
- **descriptive statistics** - mean, median, mode, frequency of demographics, etc.
- **inferential statistics** - causal relationship between IV and DV
