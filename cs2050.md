## Python
### Functional Programming Paradigm
- map - map(sq, [1, 2, 3]) -> [1, 4, 9]
- reduce
- filter - filter(odd, [1, 2, 3]) -> [1, 3]

---
## Functions
Function `f` from set **A** to set **B** (non-empty sets).
- f : **A** -> **B**
- f(a) = b, a ∈ A, b ∈ B

Term | Definition
--- | ---
Domain | "input" set, always true  
Co-Domain | set to which the domain maps onto (range is a subset of the co-domain)
1-to-1 | no collisions (no two x values have the same y value)
onto | range is equal to the co-domain (all co-domain values are utilized)

If a function is both 1-to-1 and onto, then we can find the inverse of the function.

### 1-to-1
f is 1-to-1 ↔ Ɐ`x`Ɐ`y` (f(x) = f(y) ↔ x = y)
- x, y ∈ domain of f

#### Example
Is the function f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> 1-to-1?
- if x ∈ **Z**, no
- if x ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**, yes

### Onto
f is onto ↔ Ɐy ∃x (f(x) = y)
- x, y ∈ domain of f

### Cartesian Product
f: **A** -> **B** ⊆ **A** x **B**

## Sets
**set** - unordered collection of items
```
S = {1, 2, 3}
S'= {3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1}
S = S'
```

{1, 2, **Z**, **Z<sup>+</sup>**, **R**}  
The cardinality of this set is 5.

{**Z<sup>-</sup>** U 0 U **Z<sup>+</sup>**, **Z**, **R**}  
The cardinality of this set is 2.

Notation | Set
--- | ---
List | {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...}
Set-Builder | {1/x \| x ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**}
BAD | {x \| x ∈ { 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}

### Common Sets
Name | Notation
--- | ---
Positive Quotients: **Q<sup>+</sup>** | {a / b \| a ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**, b ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**}
Null: Ø | {}

### Set Operations
Name | Operation
--- | ---
Equality | A = B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ b)
Subset | A ⊆ B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A if x ∈ b)
Proper Subset | A ⊂ B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A if x ∈ b) and there exists an x (x ⊆ B and x !⊆ A)

### Cartesian Product
A x B = { <a,b> | a ∈ A Λ b ∈ B }  
A x B x C = { <a, b, c> | a ∈ A Λ b ∈ B Λ c ∈ C }  
A x B != B x A

- ordered tuple: 2-tuple = ordered pair
- ordered 3-tuple = ordered triple
- ordered 10-tuple

#### Example 1
```
A = { cat, dog }
B = { yes, no }
A x B = { <cat,yes>, <cat,no>, <dog,yes>, <dog,no> }
```

#### Example 2
Works with sets of different cardinality as well.
```
A  = { 1, 2, 3 }
B = { 10, 20 }
A x B = { <1,10>, <1,20>, <2,10>, <2,20>, <3,10>, <3,20> }
```

### Other Combinations

- x, y ∈ Z
- Ɐ `x` Ɐ `y` (`x > 0` Λ `y > 0` Λ `x + y > 0`)

- x, y ∈ Students
- `C(x)` : x has computer
- `F(x, y)` : x + y are friends
- Ɐ `x` (`C(x)` V ∃ `y` (`F(x, y)` Λ `C(y)`))
- Ɐ `x` ∃ `y` (`C(x)` V `F(x, y)` Λ `C(y)`)

- `w` ∈ Women, `f` ∈ Flights, `a` ∈ Airlines
- P(w, f) : `w` has taken flight `f`
- Q(f, a) : flight `f` is on airline `a`
- ∃ `w` Ɐ `a` ∃ `f` (`Q(f, a)` Λ `P(w, f)`)

Atlanta is smaller than Tifton. | yes (false)
`x + 1 > x` | no (`x` is unknown, so we don't know)

### Conditionals
There are many ways to express a conditional in English.

--- | ---
if `a` then `b` | `a` → `b`
`a` if `b` | `b` → `a`
`a` only if `b` | `a` → `b`
`a` implies `b` | `a` → `b`
`a` whenever `b` | `b` → `a`
`a` is necessary for `b` | `b` → `a`

### Operator Precedence

:---: | ---
1 | `()`
2 | `¬` not
3 | `Λ` and
4 | `V` or
5 | `→` if then
6 | `↔` if and only if
7 | `≡` equivalent
