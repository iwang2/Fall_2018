## Primes and GCD
### Prime Numbers
A positive integer that is divisible by 1, itself and is >= 2.  
- **1 is not prime.**
- **composite** - not prime

---
## Binary
Converting any number to base 2.
#### Example: 241
```
241 / 2
120 / 2   R1
 60 / 2   R0
 30 / 2   R0
 15 / 2   R0
  7 / 2   R1
  3 / 2   R1
  1 / 2   R1
  0       R1
--------------
241 = 11110001
```

### Greatest Common Divisor
Break each number down to their respective prime factorizations, and take the largest combination that fits each corresponding prime factor.
```
(120, 500)
120 : 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 2 ^ 3 * 3 * 5
500 : 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 2 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 3
GCD : 2 ^ 2 * 5 = 20
```

### Least Common Multiple
Break each number down to their respective prime factorizations, and take the largest prime factor exponent within each corresponding pair.
```
(120, 500)
120 : 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 2 ^ 3 * 3 * 5
500 : 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 2 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 3
GCD : 2 ^ 3 * 3 * 5 ^ 3 = 1000
```

## Divisibility
If `a` and `b` are integers with `a != 0`, we say "a divides b" if there is an integer `c` such that `b = ac`.
- a | b ↔ ∃c (ac = b), a, b, c ∈ **Z**, a != 0
- `a` is a factor of `b`, `b` is a multiple of `a`

#### Direct Proof Example
Let a, b, c be integers, a != 0.  
if a|b and a|c, then a|(b + c)

Step | Reason
--- | ---
a\|b, a\|c | assume
b = ax, x ∈ **Z**<br>c = ay, y ∈ **Z** | by definition of divisibility
b + c = ax + ay | add LHS + RHS
b + c = a(x + y) | factor out a
a | (b + c) | by definition given (x + y) ∈ **Z**

Conclusion: If a|b and a|c then a|(b+c) as shown.

### Division "Algorithm"
a ∈ **Z**, d ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**  
∃! q, r ∈ **Z**, 0 <= r < d, such that a = dq + r
- a = dividend
- d = divisor
- q = quotient
- r = remainder

---
## Sequences
Ordered lists of elements.

Often defined as:
1. Function from a subset of the set of integers.
2. Each term as a the combination of the previous terms.

#### Example
Sequence { a<sub>n</sub> }
- n ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**
- a<sub>n</sub> = 1/n
- 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...

### Geometric Progression
ar<sup>0</sup>, ar<sup>1</sup>, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, ...
- a - initial term in the sequence
- r - common ratio
- a, r ∈ **R**

### Arithmetic Progression
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ...
- a - intial term
- d - common difference

### Summations

Summation<br>1 -> n | Recursive Style | Closed Form
--- | --- | ---
i | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n | n (n + 1) / 2

---
## Python
### Functional Programming Paradigm
- map - map(sq, [1, 2, 3]) -> [1, 4, 9]
- reduce
- filter - filter(odd, [1, 2, 3]) -> [1, 3]

---
## Functions
Function `f` from set **A** to set **B** (non-empty sets).
- f : **A** -> **B**
- f(a) = b, a ∈ A, b ∈ B

Term | Definition
--- | ---
Domain | "input" set, always true  
Co-Domain | set to which the domain maps onto (range is a subset of the co-domain)
1-to-1 | no collisions (no two x values have the same y value)
onto | range is equal to the co-domain (all co-domain values are utilized)

If a function is both 1-to-1 and onto, then we can find the inverse of the function.

### 1-to-1
f is 1-to-1 ↔ Ɐ`x`Ɐ`y` (f(x) = f(y) ↔ x = y)
- x, y ∈ domain of f

#### Example
Is the function f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> 1-to-1?
- if x ∈ **Z**, no
- if x ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**, yes

### Onto
f is onto ↔ Ɐy ∃x (f(x) = y)
- x, y ∈ domain of f

### Cartesian Product
f: **A** -> **B** ⊆ **A** x **B**

---
## Sets
**set** - unordered collection of items
```
S = {1, 2, 3}
S'= {3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1}
S = S'
```

{1, 2, **Z**, **Z<sup>+</sup>**, **R**}  
The cardinality of this set is 5.

{**Z<sup>-</sup>** U 0 U **Z<sup>+</sup>**, **Z**, **R**}  
The cardinality of this set is 2.

Set-Builder | {1/x \| x ∈ **Z<sup>+</sup>**}

### Common Sets

### Set Operations
Name | Operation
--- | ---
Equality | A = B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ b)
Subset | A ⊆ B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A if x ∈ b)
Proper Subset | A ⊂ B ↔ for all x (x ∈ A if x ∈ b) and there exists an x (x ⊆ B and x !⊆ A)

### Cartesian Product
A x B = { <a,b> | a ∈ A Λ b ∈ B }  
A x B x C = { <a, b, c> | a ∈ A Λ b ∈ B Λ c ∈ C }  
A x B != B x A

- ordered tuple: 2-tuple = ordered pair
- ordered 3-tuple = ordered triple
- ordered 10-tuple

#### Example 1
```
A = { cat, dog }
B = { yes, no }
A x B = { <cat,yes>, <cat,no>, <dog,yes>, <dog,no> }
```

#### Example 2
Works with sets of different cardinality as well.
```
A  = { 1, 2, 3 }
B = { 10, 20 }
A x B = { <1,10>, <1,20>, <2,10>, <2,20>, <3,10>, <3,20> }
```
