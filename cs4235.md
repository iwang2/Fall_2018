## The Security Mindset
- **threat sources** - actors that want to do harm
  - cybercriminals - for financial gain
  - hacktivists - activism
  - nation-states - for political advantage or espionage
- threat actors exploit vulnerabilities to launch attacks
- attacks lead to compromises or security breaches
- vulnerabilities can be found in software, networks, and humans

### Cyber Security
Strive to meet security requirements of sensitive information
- Confidentiality - who can view
- Integrity - who can write
- Availability - what is it needed for

### What Should be Done
- prevention
- detection
- response
- recovery and remediation
- policy (what) vs. mechanism (how)

### Basic Design Principles
- economy of mechanism - keep things simple
- fail-safe defaults - e.g. deny by default
- complete mediation - someone should enforce that accesses are allowed by the given policies
- open design - don't rely on the fact that your system is safe because no one knows the internals
- least privilege - only give privileges that are absolutely needed
- psychological acceptability - don't put excessive burden on people

## Software Security

### Stack
- grows from high to low addresses
- buffer overflow - can rewrite return address to execute some other code

### ShellCode
- creates a shell which allows it to execute any code the attacker wants
- when control is transferred to the shellcode, host program and system service or OS root privileges are being used

### Variations of Buffer Overflow
- **return-to-libc** - return address is overwritten to point to a standard library function
- **heap overflow** - data stored in the heap is overwritten; can be tables of function pointers (no return addresses)
- **OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability** - read more of the buffer than just the data, which may include sensitive data

### Defence Against Buffer Overflow
- programming language choice is crucial
  - strongly typed
  - automatic bounds checks
  - automatic memory management
- safe languages: Java, C++ - buffer overflow becomes impossible, but possible performance degradation
- when using unsafe languages:
  - check all input
  - use safer functions that do bounds checking
  - use automatic tools to analyze code for potential unsafe functions
- **stack canaries** - keep a canary value just before a return address to detect attempts to rewrite the address
- **ASLR** - randomizes important memory spaces (stack, heap, libc), amking it harder for the attacker to find important locations
- **non-executable stack** - prevents shellcode placed on the stack from being executed

## Operating System Security

### Operating System
- provides controlled access to hardware resources
- provides **isolation** between different processes

### Trusted Computing Base
We must trust the OS

#### TCB Requirements
1. complete mediation - should not be able to bypass; check between a request and the resource
2. tamper-proof - should not be able to alter it
3. correct - it should work as intended

### Resource Protection
OS controls acess to protected resources (complete mediation)
- must establish *source* of a request for a resource (**authentication**)
- **authorization** - access control
- mechanism that allow various policies to be supported

### Meeting TCB Requirements
- hardware support for memory protection
- processor execution modes
- privileges instructions which can only be executed in system mode

### Systems Calls
Used to transfer control between user and system code
- come through "call gates" and return back to user code

### Untrusted User Code Isolation
- ^^ hardware suport for memory protection
- ....??

### Address Space: Unit of Isolation
- you learned this like 3 times over at this point
- each process has its own mapping (virtual memory)

---
## Authentication
- OS needs to know who is making a request for a protected resource
- process making a request does it on behalf of a certain user

### Authentication Goals
Correct user should be able to sucessfuly authenticate themself
- availability
- no false negatives (incorrectly denying access)

Incorrect user should not
- authenticity
- no false positives

### Implementation
1. something a user knows
2. something a user has
3. something a user is - biometrics

### Threats to a Password
- guessing
- **trojan horse** - impersonating a real login program
- **keylogging** - grabs the password when typed on a computer

### Implementing Password Authentication
- storing list of passwords
  - why should admin know the passwords? any security breach leaks all the passwords
- hash passwords instead

### Attacks on Hashing
- determine hashes of common passwords
- dictionary attacks - brute force; requires access to hash values
- offline attacks - compute hash for common passwords, and search hash file for matching hashes (offline)

### Hash Functions Should:
- produce different values for distinct passwords
- its inverse should be very hard to compute

### Brute Force Guessing of Passwords
- rainbow table - common passwords and their hashed value
- salting - add a random number to a password to generate a different hash for two users with the same password

### Something you have
- may require additional hardware / step to authentication

### Something you are
- must get same biometric measurement each time
- should not get false positives or negatives

### Other Authentication Methods
- **multi-factor** - combines the different authentication methods to reduce the number of false positives
- **over a network** - remote services; means there is NO trusted path (cryptography needed)

## Access Control

### Controlling Accesses to Resources
1. decide who should have access (**access control policy**)
2. enforcement - only accesses defined by the access control policy are granted

**complete mediation** - no one should be able to bypass acess control; essential for successful enforcement

### Discretionary Access Control
- access to a resource is at the discretion of the owner
- problematic - alice gives read access to bob, and bob copies it and shares it with someone else
- information flow problem - you cannot control what someone will do if you share a file with them

### Access Control Matrix
Contains all information relevant to access control (rows: sources, cols: resources); takes up a lot of space
- **Access Control List** - list of users who have access per object
  - should be stored in trusted part of the system along with other object meta-data
- **Capability List** - list of objects per user
  - per user; can be stored in the objects themselves

### ACL vs CL
- efficiency - CL
- accountability - ACL
- revocation - ACL

### ACL in Unix
- each file has an owner (unique user ID)
- access possible for owner, group, and world
- permissions r-w-x
- setuid - for users to have write access for a specific period of time; temporarily changes user id from owner to the user
- inode - information about each file and its metadata

### Role Based Access Control
- rights associated by roles
- enterprise - access based on job function or user role
- users authenticate, and then can activate one or more roles

#### Benefits
- policy does not need to be updated when someone leaves
- start with minimum accesses
- roles are resource related (groups are subject related)

---
## Mandatory Access Control
- not at user discretion
- solves information control problem
- e.g. although users create data in a company, the company decides who should be able to share it

### Implementation
- labels - indicate sensitivity/category of data
- TCB associates labels with each user and object, and checks them when access requests are made
- labels are comparable; dpeneding on what kind of model is implemented
  - DoD - include classification/clearance level, and compartment in the label
  - commercial - deal with conflict of interest separation

### Using Labels for Mac: Confidentiality
