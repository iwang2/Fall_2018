## Arrays
Retrieving an element with a known index is done in O(1) time.  
The cost of resizing an array is O(n).

**SIZE** - number of elements in the array  
**CAPACITY** - maximum size of the array

## ArrayList
Initial capacity is 10. Capacity is dynamic.
- no gaps between elements

Adding someone to a full ArrayList requires resizing which is O(n), but ordinarily adding is O(1), splitting the cost of that one O(n) operation. **Adding is always considered O(1).**

## Linked List
