## Hash Maps
(key, value)
- `key` - unique integers (index)
- `value` - change

### Resolving Collisions
- pointer to Linked List node
- formula to move index (if the array is big enough)

#### External Chaining (closed addressing)
Using a Singly Linked List
- <k, k>

### Maps vs. Tables
Map | Table
--- | ---
null | no null
faster | slower
less memory | more memory
no synchronization | synchronization
iterator | enumerator

---
## Heaps
Heapify is O(n), not O(nlogn)

---
## Arrays
- static memory allocation
- flexible data types
- write your own methods

Retrieving an element with a known index is done in O(1) time.  
The cost of resizing an array is O(n).

**SIZE** - number of elements in the array  
**CAPACITY** - maximum size of the array

## ArrayList
- dynamic data structures
- initial capacity is 10
- no gaps between elements
- methods are provided

Adding someone to a full ArrayList requires resizing which is O(n), but ordinarily adding is O(1), splitting the cost of that one O(n) operation. **Adding is always considered O(1).**
