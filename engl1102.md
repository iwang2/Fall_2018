# English 1102 - Women in Science Fiction

Instead of 5 paragraph essays, we will use claim and reason.

### The Enthymeme
Like the transitive property, but for logical arguments.  
`A = B, B = C, A = C`  

Part | Example
--- | ---
claim (the answer to the question at issue) | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia.
reason | Its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
2 independent clauses | claim + reason (both can stand on their own)
because | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia because its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
shared term | recreational marijuana
unstated assumption | Something should be legal in Georgia if its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.

### Question at Issue
1. relevant
2. specific and concise
3. answerable
4. debatable
