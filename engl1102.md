## Feminism
Wave | Time Period | Subject
--- | --- | ---
1st | 19th - 20th c. | - right to vote<br>- property rights
2nd | 1950s - 1970s | Named *Women's Liberation* (not feminism)<br>- liberal feminism (individual freedoms for women: politics, law)<br>- radical feminism (burn it all down; the system is inherently flawed)
3rd | 1980s - ? | - criticism of 2nd wave feminism<br>- black, chicana, and 3rd world feminism<br>- ***intersectionality***

### Marx and Engels
The Communist Manifesto:
- **bourgeoise** - control the means of production
- **proletariat** - provide the labor for production

### Shulamith Firestone
A radical feminist, critical of Marx & Engels, but believed that they had some good ideas.
- **men** - control everything
- **women** - do the work

The conflict between men and women comes down to reproduction, so eliminate that difference. Make the matter of having and raising a child equal between all sexes.

Instead of 5 paragraph essays, we will use claim and reason.

## The Enthymeme
Like the transitive property, but for logical arguments.  
`A = B, B = C, A = C`  

Part | Example
--- | ---
claim (the answer to the question at issue) | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia.
reason | Its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
2 independent clauses | claim + reason (both can stand on their own)
because | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia because its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
shared term | recreational marijuana
unstated assumption | Something should be legal in Georgia if its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.

### Question at Issue
1. relevant
2. specific and concise
3. answerable
4. debatable
