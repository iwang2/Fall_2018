### Mark Dery
> *"Speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses AFrican-American concerns in the context of twentieth-century technoculture--might, for want of a better term, be called 'Afrofuturism.'"*

### Samuel Delaney
> *"When, indeed, we say that [America] was founded on sslavery, we must remember that we mean, specifically, that it was founded on the systemic, conscientious, and massive destruction of African cultural remnants."*

### Kodwo Eshun
> *"Look, all those things that you already read about alien abduction and genetic transformation, they already happened. How much more alien do you think it gets than slavery? Than entire mass populations moved and genetically altered. It doesn't get much more alien than that."*

### Alondra Nelson
> Afrofuturist tests should *"reflect AFrican diasporic experience and at the same time attend to the transformations that are the by-product of new media and information technology. They [should] excavate and create original narratives of identity, technology, and the future and offer critiques of the promises of prevailing theories of technoculture."*

White Western science fiction is either horrifying or wonderful (new planet, new things).

Afrofuturism is inherently devoted to recovering the past and integrating it into all possible visions of the future.

- **Kendrick Lamar** - myth of the flying Africans; historians believe it refers to a mass suicide of African slaves on Igbo landing
- **Beyonce** - *Lemondae* is not just about Jay-Z's infidelity

## Feminism
Wave | Time Period | Subject
--- | --- | ---
1st | 19th - 20th c. | - right to vote<br>- property rights
2nd | 1950s - 1970s | Named *Women's Liberation* (not feminism)<br>- liberal feminism (individual freedoms for women: politics, law)<br>- radical feminism (burn it all down; the system is inherently flawed)
3rd | 1980s - ? | - criticism of 2nd wave feminism<br>- black, chicana, and 3rd world feminism<br>- ***intersectionality***

### Marx and Engels
The Communist Manifesto:
- **bourgeoise** - control the means of production
- **proletariat** - provide the labor for production

### Shulamith Firestone
A radical feminist, critical of Marx & Engels, but believed that they had some good ideas.
- **men** - control everything
- **women** - do the work

The conflict between men and women comes down to reproduction, so eliminate that difference. Make the matter of having and raising a child equal between all sexes.

Instead of 5 paragraph essays, we will use claim and reason.

## The Enthymeme
Like the transitive property, but for logical arguments.  
`A = B, B = C, A = C`  

Part | Example
--- | ---
claim (the answer to the question at issue) | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia.
reason | Its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
2 independent clauses | claim + reason (both can stand on their own)
because | Recreational marijuana should be legal in Georgia because its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.
shared term | recreational marijuana
unstated assumption | Something should be legal in Georgia if its legalization will dramatically decrease unjust mass incarceration.

### Question at Issue
1. relevant
2. specific and concise
3. answerable
4. debatable
