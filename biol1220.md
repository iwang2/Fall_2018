## Hypothesis, Experimental Design, Prediction
- **hypothesis** - testable and falsifiable  
- **experimental design** - is the hypothesis supported
- **prediction** - specific outcome we expect to see when using a *particular* experimental design

## What is life?
### NASA's definition
> "self-sustaining"

### Features of Living Things
1. **Compartmentalization** - one or more membrane-bound *cells* (distinguishes them from the outside), not all have membrane-bound organelles
2. **Genetic information** - stored and read in order to be able to reproduce
   replication -> transcription (DNA -> RNA) -> translation (RNA -> protein)
3. **Energy**
4. **Replication** - sexual (offspring similar to parents) or asexual (offspring identical) reproduction
5. **Evolution** - Lamarck (inheritance of acquired characteristics) vs. Darwin and Wallace (natural selection)

### Evolution
An individual cannot evolve by definition of Darwin's evolution.

Evolution is an *emergent* property of life. 
- it's not perfect, and mistakes happen
- all genetic information of living organisms is in DNA

Evolution is a **fact** (that life changes over time), only Darwin's idea that it happens by natural selection is a **theory**.

#### Evidence of Evolution
- layers in a fossil record (sequential change from old to young); but there are some gaps (e.g. transitional species between fish and tetrapods)

### Classification System
Linnaean system changed with DNA sequencing.  
There are now  3 domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), replacing the highest order of the 5 kingdoms.
Archaea and Eukarya are more closely related to each other than to bacteria.
