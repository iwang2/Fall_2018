## Hypothesis, Experimental Design, Prediction
- **hypothesis** - testable and falsifiable  
- **experimental design** - is the hypothesis supported
- **prediction** - specific outcome we expect to see when using a *particular* experimental design

## What is life?
### NASA's definition
> "self-sustaining"

### Features of Living Things
1. **Compartmentalization** - one or more membrane-bound *cells* (distinguishes them from the outside), not all have membrane-bound organelles
2. **Genetic information** - stored and read in order to be able to reproduce
   replication -> transcription (DNA -> RNA) -> translation (RNA -> protein)
3. **Energy**
4. **Replication** - sexual (offspring similar to parents) or asexual (offspring identical) reproduction
5. **Evolution** - Lamarck (inheritance of acquired characteristics) vs. Darwin and Wallace (natural selection)

### Evolution
An individual cannot evolve by definition of Darwin's evolution.

Evolution is an *emergent* property of life. 
- it's not perfect, and mistakes happen
- all genetic information of living organisms is in DNA

Evolution is a **fact** (that life changes over time), only Darwin's idea that it happens by natural selection is a **theory**.

#### Evidence of Evolution
- layers in a fossil record (sequential change from old to young); but there are some gaps (e.g. transitional species between fish and tetrapods)

Hierarchy | Acronym
--- | ---
Kingdom | King
Phylum | Phillip  
Class | Came
Order | Over
Family | For
Genus | Good
Species | Sport

### Classification System
Linnaean system changed with DNA sequencing.  
There are now  3 domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), replacing the highest order of the 5 kingdoms.
Archaea and Eukarya are more closely related to each other than to bacteria.

## Biodiversity
### Key Phases in Sexual Life Cycle
adult -> gamete -> zygote -> juvenile

Organisms differ in cell structure, morphologies, reproduction methods, and behavior. 

### Biodiversity is hierarchical
1. biosphere - global processes
2. ecosystem - how energy moves between organisms, nutrient cycle
3. community - interaction amongst populations
4. population - pop. dynamics; unit of evolution
5. organism - survial and reproduction; unit of natural selection

### Biomes
Regional/global land area characterized by the organisms and climate in that area  
Organized by latitude (mostly, unless there are mountains); mirrored around the equator.

Biodiversity is measured by species richness (# of species) and evenness (proportion of species).  
**Endemic species** - found in a particular area and nowhere else  
Species richness is highest at the equator (tropical rainforest), and lowest in the tundra. 

### Why is Biodiversity Important?
It provides ecosystem services.

- provisioning - food, resources (humans)
- cultural - aesthetics, recreation (humans)
- regulating - climate moderation, soil, erosion control (e.g grass roots anchoring), oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> regulation,are and water cleaning, etc.
- supporting services - primary production, nutrient cycling, pollination, biological control

### Bacteria are everywhere
- single-celled, microscopic
- they are inside you (outnumber human cells 3 to 1; skin, gut, up the nose)
- most are beneficial

### Archaea
- They are "extremophiles," and live in extreme environments (high concentrations of salt, metals, toxins)
- a very small percentage live in our gut (mostly consume methane, a by-product of bacterial metabolism0
- environmental remediation

### Endosymbiotic Theory: how eukaryotes evolved
For example, proto-eukaryotes:
1. DNA clump and membrane
2. nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum
3. took in an aerobic bacterium
4. a. photosysthesis  bacterium -> evolves to chloroplast  
   b. modern heterotrophic eukaryote -> aerobic bacterium evoles to mitochondrion

## Phylogenetic Trees

### Data used in constructing trees:
#### Morphological
- structural features
- organs
- skeletal arrangements
#### Genetics
- mitochondrial DNA
- ribosomal RNA
- lots of different genes

### Concepts used in constructing trees:
- homology
- parsimony

## Evolution by Natural Selection

Evolution is the change in gene (allele) frequencies over time in a population.  
This may occure through: mutation, gene flow/migration, or selection.

### Selection (a THEORY)
Change in the heritable characteristics of a population over succeeding generations resulting in *differential* survival and reproduction.

#### Steps for Natural Selection
1. trait must be **variable** in population
2. must be **heritable**
3. struggle of existence (more offspring are born than can survive)
4. **differential survival and reproduction**

These lead to **adaptations** (Traits that make an organism a better fit for its environment.

### Artificial Selection
Breeders can change a species by choosing individuals with interesting traits that occur at random. Over generations, the traits become more and more common.

### Common Traits in Domesticated Species
- drooping ears
- piebald coloration, forehead star
- wavy hair
- rolled, shorter tails
- changes in reproductive cycles (faster than in nature)

Dogs were the first domesticated animal, and are essentially the same species as gray wolves.
- wolves: *Canis lupus*
- dogs: *Canis lupus familiaris*

### Nature vs. Nurture
Belyaev hypothesized that variation in tameness is genetic.  
Experiment demonstrates that selection for a single characteristic was also towing along other unselected traits.

## Why Symbionts Matter
 Effect | - | + | 0
 --- | --- | --- | ---
 \- | competition | predation<br>herbivory<br>parasitism | 
 \+ | predation<br>herbivory<br>parasitism | mutualism | 
 0 | 

### Symbiosis
Close and long-term biological interactions.  
Parasitism and mutualism are generally considered to the best two examples (not competition, herbivory, or predation). 

Parasitoid wasps lay their eggs inside other insects

Symbiosis | + | -
 --- | --- | ---
 Parasitism | place for eggs<br>stable environment<br>increased survival & reproduction | reduction of host nutrients<br>may kill the host<br>descrease in survival/reproduction
 Mutualism | parasite removal<br>defense | don't cheat<br>**dependency**
 
 ### Microbiota
 Collection of microorganisms that reside in or on another organism.
 - bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi, (viruses)
 - can be commensal, mutualistic, parasitic, opportunistically pathogenic (can sometimes cause disease)
 
 #### Human-microbioata interactions are usually mutualisms
 ##### Diet
 - break down complex carbs
 - sythesize vitamins such as biotin and folate
 - enhance absorption of lipids and bvitamin K
 ##### Health
 - "train" immmune system
 - inhibits growth of pathogens
 - may influence CNS function (mood, stress, neurological disorders)
 
 ### Human Milk Oligosaccharides
 - complex sugars found, over 200 differen HMOs known
 - more abundant than protein in human milk (up to 1/3 of human milk volume)
 - *cannot be digested by babies* - to be fed to the microbiome of the baby
