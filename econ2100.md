## The Core Principles of Economics
- **cost-benefit** (either/or) - pursue only those choices whose benefits are at least as large as their costs
  - *economic surplus* - total benefit - cost flowing from a decision; measure of how much your decision has improved your well-being
  - *framing effects* - can lead you astray and make identical choices seem different
- **opportunity cost** (or what) - the true cost of something is the next best alternative you must give up to get it (comparing trade-offs); not necessarily financial costs
  - *scarcity* - fundamental economic problem of limited resources
  - *sunk costs* - exists whether you make your choice or not
  - *production possibilities frontier (PPF)* - visualize opportunity cost (producing inside PPF is inefficient, producing outside requires some other change)
- **marginal** (one more) - decisions about quantities are best made incrementally
  - *marginal benefit/cost* - the benefit/cost from one unit
  - *rational rule* - if something is worth doing, keep doing it until your marginal benefits equals your marginal costs (maximizes economic surplus)
- **interdependence** (what else) - your choice depends on a lot of things
  1. your choices - dependencies between each of your individual choices
  2. others' choices - dependencies between people or businesses in the same market
  3. other markets - dependencies between markets
  4. future choices - dependencies through time

## Demand

### Individual Demand Curve
- plotting the quantity of an item that someone plans to buy at each price
  - scatter plot, not a curve
  - x and y are flipped
- at the given price, how many should I buy?
- holds other things constant (first, consider only one variable)
- **law of demand** - the cheaper something is, the more people with buy it (downward sloping curve)

### Your Decisions and Your Demand Curve
- **Rational Rule for Buyers** - buy more of an item if its marginal benefit is greater than the cost
- the demand curve is also the marginal benefit curve
- **diminishing marginal benefit** - each additional item yields a smaller marginal benefit than the previous item (the reason behind the law of demand)
- individual demand reflects marginal benefits

### Market Demand: What the Market Wants
- **market demand curve** - sum of the quantity demanded by the entire item
- also obeys the law of demand
- price changes quantity demanded for both new and old customers
  - if prices are low, # of customers increases, and old customers may buy more

#### Steps to Estimating
1. survey customers
2. add up the total quantity demanded by customers at each price
3. scale up quantities so they represent the whole market
4. plot the total quantity demanded at each price

### What Shifts Demand Curves
- shift in the demand curve - movement of the curve
- increase in demand - shift to the right
- decrease in demand - shift to the left

#### Factors That Change Both Individual and Market Curves
1. income
   - **normal good** - good for which higher income causes and increase in demand
   - **inferior good** - good for which higher income causes a decrease in demand
2. preferences
   - companies using advertising
   - social pressure
   - fashion trends
3. prices of related goods
   - **complementary goods** - goods that go together (e.g hot dogs and hot dog buns)
   - **substitute goods** - goods that replace each other
     - demand will increase if the price of a substitute good rises
4. expectations
   - if you think prices will rise, you will make your purchase today, increase today's demand
   - if you believe prices will fall, you will delay your purchase, decreasing today's demand
5. congestion and network effects
   - **network effect** - when a good becomes more useful because other people use it (e.g. social media platforms)
   - **congestion effect** - when a good becomes less valuable because other people use it (e.g. roads)

#### Factors That Only Change Market Demand
1. the type and number of buyers
   - if the composition of the market changes, market demand will also change
   - market demand increases over time as the population grows

### Shifts vs Movements Along Demand Curves
- price change - movement
- other factors - shift
