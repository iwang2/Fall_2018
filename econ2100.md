## The Core Principles of Economics
- **cost-benefit** (either/or) - pursue only those choices whose benefits are at least as large as their costs
  - *economic surplus* - total benefit - cost flowing from a decision; measure of how much your decision has improved your well-being
  - *framing effects* - can lead you astray and make identical choices seem different
- **opportunity cost** (or what) - the true cost of something is the next best alternative you must give up to get it (comparing trade-offs); not necessarily financial costs
  - *scarcity* - fundamental economic problem of limited resources
  - *sunk costs* - exists whether you make your choice or not
  - *production possibilities frontier (PPF)* - visualize opportunity cost (producing inside PPF is inefficient, producing outside requires some other change)
- **marginal** (one more) - decisions about quantities are best made incrementally
  - *marginal benefit/cost* - the benefit/cost from one unit
  - *rational rule* - if something is worth doing, keep doing it until your marginal benefits equals your marginal costs (maximizes economic surplus)
- **interdependence** (what else) - your choice depends on a lot of things
  1. your choices - dependencies between each of your individual choices
  2. others' choices - dependencies between people or businesses in the same market
  3. other markets - dependencies between markets
  4. future choices - dependencies through time

## Demand

### Individual Demand Curve
- plotting the quantity of an item that someone plans to buy at each price
  - scatter plot, not a curve
  - x and y are flipped
- at the given price, how many should I buy?
- holds other things constant (first, consider only one variable)
- **law of demand** - the cheaper something is, the more people with buy it (downward sloping curve)

### Your Decisions and Your Demand Curve
- **Rational Rule for Buyers** - buy more of an item if its marginal benefit is greater than the cost
- the demand curve is also the marginal benefit curve
- **diminishing marginal benefit** - each additional item yields a smaller marginal benefit than the previous item (the reason behind the law of demand)
- individual demand reflects marginal benefits

### Market Demand: What the Market Wants
- **market demand curve** - sum of the quantity demanded by the entire item
- also obeys the law of demand
- price changes quantity demanded for both new and old customers
  - if prices are low, # of customers increases, and old customers may buy more

#### Steps to Estimating
1. survey customers
2. add up the total quantity demanded by customers at each price
3. scale up quantities so they represent the whole market
4. plot the total quantity demanded at each price

### What Shifts Demand Curves
- shift in the demand curve - movement of the curve
- increase in demand - shift to the right
- decrease in demand - shift to the left

#### Factors That Change Both Individual and Market Curves
1. income
   - **normal good** - good for which higher income causes and increase in demand
   - **inferior good** - good for which higher income causes a decrease in demand
2. preferences
   - companies using advertising
   - social pressure
   - fashion trends
3. prices of related goods
   - **complementary goods** - goods that go together (e.g hot dogs and hot dog buns)
   - **substitute goods** - goods that replace each other
     - demand will increase if the price of a substitute good rises
4. expectations
   - if you think prices will rise, you will make your purchase today, increase today's demand
   - if you believe prices will fall, you will delay your purchase, decreasing today's demand
5. congestion and network effects
   - **network effect** - when a good becomes more useful because other people use it (e.g. social media platforms)
   - **congestion effect** - when a good becomes less valuable because other people use it (e.g. roads)

#### Factors That Only Change Market Demand
1. the type and number of buyers
   - if the composition of the market changes, market demand will also change
   - market demand increases over time as the population grows

### Shifts vs Movements Along Demand Curves
- price change - movement
- other factors - shift

---
## Supply

### Individual Supply Curve
- the quantity of an item that a business plans to sell at each price
- selling plans; holds all other things constant
- **law of supply** - upward sloping, unlike demand (the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied)

### Perfectly Competitive Markets
- all firms in the industry sell an identical good
- many buyers and sellers, small relative to the size of the market
- **price-taker** - an actor who charges the market price; actions do not affect the market price

### Choosing the Best Quantity to Supply
- use MCOI
- MC - produce one more unit if marginal benefit > marginal cost
- O - when determining marginal cost, compare production cost to the next best option: not producing (produce or don't produce?)
  - marginal cost includes variable costs, but not fixed costs
- **variable costs** - costs that vary with the quantity of output (e.g labor, raw materials)
- **fixed costs** - incurred regarless of level of output
- I - best choice depends on a bunch of other choices, but for now hold constant (perfectly competitive market)

### Rational Rule for Sellers in Competitive Markets
Sell one more item if the price is >= the marginal cost
- to maximize profit, keep applying the rule and product until price = marginal cost

### Supply Curve
- supply curve = marginal cost curve
- upward sloping because of increasing marginal costs
- as you produce more, the marginal cost of producing an extra unit rises
  - **diminishing marginal product** - the marginal product of an input declines as you use more of that input (leads to rising marginal costs)
  - rising input costs also lead to rising marginal costs

### Market Supply Curve
Total quantity of an item supplied by the entire market at each price
- slopes upward (follows law of supply)
  - higher price: individual businesses supply a larger quanitty, and more bussinesses are supplying their goods and services
  - lower price: fewer businesses are doing so
- movement along the supply curve: price change or change in quantity

### Market Supply Curve Shifts
- **increase/decrease in supply** - shift to the right/left
- *interdependence principle* - sellers choices depend on many other factors than price

#### Shifts Both Individual and Market Curve:
1. input prices
   - **interdependence** - choices of other businesses affect your decisions
2. productivity and technology
   - **productivity growth** - when businesses figure out how to produce more output with fewer input
   - often driven by **technological change**
3. prices of related outputs
   - **substitutes-in-production** - alternative uses of your production capacity (e.g. producing orange popsicles in the summer, and orange juice in the winter)
   - **complements-in-production** - goods that are made together (e.g. leather and beef)
4. expectations
   - decisions are linked through time

#### Shifts Only the Market Supply Curve:
1. type and number of sellers
   - any factor that changes expected future profits will change the number of suppliers in the market
   - if new business enter, supply increases; if businesses shut down, supply decreases

### Shifts vs. Movement
- price changes = movement
- other factors = shift

### Demand vs. Supply
Category | Demand | Supply
--- | --- | ---
Objective | maximize economic surplus (benefit - price) | maximize profit (revenue - cost)
To decide on quantity | Rational Rule for Buyers:<br>buy one ore if marginal benefit >= price | Rational Rule for Sellers:<br>sell one more if price >= marginal cost
Graph | demand curve = marginal benefit curve | supply curve = marginal cost curve
Curve Slopes | downwards because of diminishing marginal benefit | upwards because of increasing marginal cost
Rise in prices causes | reduction in quantity demanded | raise in quantity supplied
Fall in price causes | raise in quantity demanded | reduction in quantity supplied
Causes of Shifts | - income<br>- preferences<br>- prices of substitutes / complements<br>- expectations<br>- congestion / network effects<br>- type and # of consumers (market only) | - input prices<br>- productivity and technology<br>- prices of substitues and complements (in production)<br>- expectations<br>- tpye and # of sellers (market only)

## Equilibrium: Where Supply Meets Demand

### Markets
- any setting that brings together potential buyers and sellers
- they determine:
  - what gets produced
  - how much
  - who produces it
  - who receives it
  - at what price
- outcomes determined based on both *supply* and *demand*

### Market Equilibrium
- quantity supplied = quantity demanded
- at equilibrium, suppliers and demanders have no incentive to change
- at any price higher than equilibrium price (quantity > demand) there is a **surplus**
- at any price below the equilibrium price (quantity < demand), there is a **shortage**

### Predicting Market Outcomes
1. Is it the supply or demand curve shifting?
2. Is it and increase or decrease (right or left shift)?
3. How will prices and quantities change in the new equilibrium?

When both supply and demand shift, effects on price and quantity will depend.

## Elasticity: Measuring Responsiveness
Measure of how much quantities demanded and supplied respond to changing market conditions

### Price Elasticity of Demand
A measure of how responsive buyers are to price changes
- determines by how much demand will fall when prices rise
- = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price
- by what percent quantity demanded changes in response to a 1% price change (the slope of the demand curve)
- this value is negative  (to follow the law of demand)
- use the absolute value

### How Businesses Use Demand Elasticity
- **total revenue** - total amount received from buyers; price * quantity
- elastic demand - higher price yields less revenue
- inelastic demand - higher price yields more revenue

### Other Demand Elasticities
- **cross-price elasticity of demand** - how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another
  - % change in quantity demanded / % change in price of another good
  - percentage change in demand following a 1% price rise in another good
  - positive for substitutes
  - negative for complements
- **income elasticity of demand** - how responsive demand is to changes in income
  - % change in quantity demanded / % change in income
  - positive for normal goods
  - negative for inferior goods

### Price Elasticity of Supply
How responsive sellers are to price changes
- % change in quantity supplied / % change in price
- positive bc of the law of supply
- depends on how flexible your business can be

#### Determinants
The price elasticity of supply is larger in the following circumstances:
1. for firms that store inventories
2. when inputs are easily available
3. for firms w/ extra capacity
4. when firms can easily enter and exit the market
5. when there's more time to adjust

#### Calculating
- use midpoints as the sum for change

---
## Government Intervention

### Taxes

#### Tax on Sellers
- shifts supply curve to the left to reflect higher marginal costs
- leads to a decline in quantity sold
- increases price that buyers pay, and decreases price that sellers receive
- sellers will take some of the hit to increase the quantity sold

#### Tax on Buyers
- shifts demand curve left

#### Burden of a Tax
- both sellers and buyers bear the burden, regardless of who actually gets taxed
- the economic effect is the same regardless of who is taxed (theoretically)
- **statutory burden** - burden of being the one taxed by the government
- **economic burden** - burden created by the change in after-tax prices faced by buyers and sellers
- **tax incidence** - division of the economic burden of a tax between buyers and sellers
  - depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply
  - sellers bear a smaller share of the economic burden when supply is more elastic (they can produce something else)
  - buyers bear a smaller share when demand is more elastic (they can buy something else)

### Subsidies
A payment made by the government to those who make a specific choice
- doesn't matter who gets the subsidy
- divided based on elasticities

### Price Regulations
- **price ceiling/floor** - max/min price that sellers can charge
- **binding price ceiling** - price ceiling that prevents the market from reaching the market equilibrium price
  - lowers prices and reduces quantity sold
  - causes shortages
- **binding price floor** - price floor that prevents market from reaching the equilibrium price
  - raises prices and lowers quantity sold
  - causes surplus

### Quantity Regulations
A min/max quantity that can be sold
- **mandate** - requirement to buy/sell a minimum amount of a good
- **quota** - a limit on the maximum quantity that can be sold

---
## Welfare and Efficiency

### Evaluating Public Policies
1. **positive analysis** - *describes* what is happening, explaining why or predicting what will happen
   - what is going to happen if we adopt this policy?
2. **normative analysis** - prescribes what should happen, which involves value *judgements*
   - which is the better outcome, and what policy should the government adopt?

### Measuring Economic Surplus
- **consumer surplus** - economic surplus you get from buying something
  - = marginal benefit - price
- **producer surplus** - economic surplus you get from selling something
  - = price - marginal cost
- **voluntary exchange** - buyers and sellers exchange money for goods only if they both want to
  - ensures both enjoy *gains from trade*
  - **economic surplus** = consumer surplus + producer surplus = marginal benefit - marginal cost

### Market Efficiency
- **Rational Rule for Markets**: produce until marginal benefit = marginal cost
- **efficient production** - producing a given quantity of output at the lowest possible cost
  - minimizes costs
  - requires allocating production so that each item is produce at the lowest marginal cost
- **efficient allocation** - allocating goods to create the largest economic surplus
  - maximizes benefits
  - requires that each good goes to the person who will receive the highest marginal benefit for it
- **efficient quantity** - quantity that produces the largest possible economic surplus
- supply and demand produces the surplus-maximizing quantity

### Market Failure and Deadweight Loss
- **market failure** - when supply and demand lead to an inefficient outcome
- five sources:
  1. market power
  2. externalities
  3. information problems (when one side has more information than the other)
  4. irrationality (people are unpredictable)
  5. government regulations
- **deadweight loss** - how far economic surplus falls below the efficient outcome
  - = economic surplus at efficient quantity - actual economic surplus
  - quantities rather prices create deadweight loss
- government policies can limit market failure
- but there is also **government failure** when policies lead to worse outcomes
  - limits the extent to which we should rely on the government

### Beyond Economic Efficiency
#### Critiques of Economic Efficiency
1. distribution matters, so it's also important to account for equity
2. willingness to pay reflects ability to pay, not just marginal benefit
3. the means matter, not just the ends

## Gains from Trade
The benefits that come from reallocating resources, goods, and services to better uses.
- created by markets by effectively allocating tasks

### Comparative Advantage
The ability to do a task at a lower opportunity cost (compared to yourself, not necessarily your output compared to others)
- **absolute advantage** - the ability to do a task using fewer inputs (or produce the most amount of output given the same amount of input)

#### Markets Facilitate Gains from Trade
- markets offer the opportunity to specialize according to comparative advantage
- do more of waht you're relatively good at and less of the other stuff

#### Comparative Advantage Drives International Trade
- incentive for people around the world to focus on what they're best at, even when that person lives overseas

### The Role of Prices
1. signal: price is a line of communication between buyers and sellers 
   - help coordinate better outcomes
2. incentive - incentive for strangers to cooperate
   - high price: incentive for suppliers to produce more, and for buyers to consume less
3. bundle of information - the process of buying and selling aggregates information; market prices broadcast useful information
   - **prediction markets** - markets whose payoffs are linked to whether an uncertain event occurs

### Harnessing Market Forces
- **internal market** - market within a company to buy and sell scarce resources
  - **knowledge problem** - knowledge needed to make a good decision is not available to decision maker
  - solved by internal markets because they do not rely on a centralized decision maker
  - used by managers to allocate scarce resources and can improve forecasts (with the internal prediction market)

---
## Externalities and Public Goods
- **externality** - side effect that affects bystanders whose interests aren't taken into account
- **negative/positive externality** - externality that harms/benefits bystanders
  - negative externalities impose costs on others
  - positive externalities generate benefits for others, but still lead to market failure because even better outcomes are possible (bystanders will do less beneficial activities than is in society's best interest)
- a price change is not an externality (it's a direct effect)

### Conflict Between Private/Societal Interests
- negative externalities create external costs
  - **marginal private cost** - extra cost from one extra unit paid by the seller (curve matches the supply curve)
  - **external cost** - cost imposed on bystanders
  - **marginal external cost** - extra external cost from one extra unit
  - **marginal social cost** - all marginal costs (marginal private + marginal external cost)
- positive externalities create external benefits
  - **marginal private benefit** - external benefit from one extra unit enjoyed by the buyer (curve matches the demand curve)
  - **external benefit** - benefit to bystanders
  - **marginal external benefit** - extra external benefit from one extra unit
  - **marginal social benefit** - all marginal benefits (marginal private + marginal external benefit)

### The Externality Problem
- **Rational Rule for Society** - produce more of a product as long as its marginal social benefit is at least as large as the marginal social cost
- **socially optimal outcome**: marginal social benefit = marginal social cost
  - the outcome that is most socially efficient for everyone
- negative = overproduction, positive = overproduction

### Solving Externality Problems
1. private bargaining
   - **coase theorem** - *if bargaining is costless*, property rights are clearly established and enforced, and externality problems can then be solved by private bargains
   - can restore the socially optimal outcome
   - types: strategic investments and mergers
   - when bargaining is difficult, externalities remain a problem
2. fix the price: corrective taxes and subsidies
   - **corrective tax** - designed to induce people to take account of the negative externalities they cause (like a swear jar)
   - **corrective subsidy** - fix positive externalities
3. fix the quantity: cap and trade - quantity regulation implemented by allocatin a dixed number of permits, which can then be traded (like a corrective tax)
   - **quota** - limit on the maximum quantity of a good or service that can be sold
4. laws, rules, and regulations - previous 3 try to harness the power of the market to solve externality problems as efficiently as possible; regulations are needed when doing so is not possible
5. government provision of public goods
   - just bc the govt provides something, doesn't mean that it is a public good
   - just bc something is a public good doesn't mean that the govt should fund it
   - just bc the govt should fund a public good doesn't mean that the govt should provide it
6. assign ownership rights
   - solves common resource problems
   - **common resource** - rival and nonexcludable (e.g. fish in the pond)
   - **tragedy of the commons** - tendency to overconsume a common resource

### Public Goods and the Tragedy of the Commons
- **nonexcludable** - when people cannot easily be excluded from using a good
- causes specific problem of whether when one uses the good, it causes harm to another
- **nonrival good** - a good for which one person's use doesn't subtract from another's
- when something is nonexcludable, the *free-rider* problem can occur
  - **free-rider problem** - a situation that arises when someone can enjoy the benefits of a good without bearing the costs
- with nonrival goods, free-riders enjoy positive externalities without hurting others
- when goods or services are rival and it's easy to exclude those who don't pay, there is no free-rider problem
- **rival good** - good for which your use comes at someone else's expense
- **public goods** - nonrival goods afflcited by the free-rider problem
- businesses try to turn public goods into club good
  - **club good** - excludable but nonrival in consumption (available to anyone within a specific organization)

---
## The Labor Market
- wages are the price of labor
- hours of work / employment are the quantity of labor

### Law of Supply in the Labor Market
- labor demand: downward sloping
  - high wages --> hire fewer employees
  - low wages --> employers hire more, stay open longer and sell more goods
- supply of labor: upward sloping
  - as the wage of a job rises, more people will want to do that job

### Labor Demand
- in a competitive labor market, employers pay the market wage
- **marginal product (output ) of labor** - extra production that occurs from hiring an extra worker
- **marginal revenue product** - marginal revenue from hiring an extra worker
- **rational rule for employers** - hire more workers if the marginal revenue product is >= wage (maximizes profits)
- labor demand = marginal revenue product

### Shifts in Labor Demand
1. changes in demand for the product
   - **derived demand** - demand for labor comes from the demand for the stuff labor makes
2. changes in the price of capital (technology)
   - **scale effect** - when the price of capital declines, you can produce output more cheaply, so you need more workers to produce more things
   - **substitution effect** - if you can replace labor with capital, your need for workers will fall
3. better management and productivity gains
4. nonwage benefits, subsidies, and taxes - changing incentives

### Rational Rule for Workers
Work one more hour as long as the wage is at least as large as the marginal benefit of another hour of leisure.
- the *substitution effect* measures how people respond to changes in relative prices; higher wages make work relatively more attractive
- the *income effect* measures how people respond to changes in income and says higher income makes leisure more attractive
- these two effects lead to a backward bending labor supply curve
  - at very low wages, it's not worth working
  - as wages rise, incentive to work rises (substitution effect)
  - at high wages, time is more scarce than money (income effect)
- **all labor supply curves are roughly vertical**

### Market Labor Supply Curve
Slopes Upward Because:
1. new people may enter the workforce as the wage rises
2. existing workers may put in more hours as the wage rises
3. some people may switch occupations to those with higher wages

Shifts Because:
1. changing wages in other occupations
2. changing number of potential workers
3. changing benefits of not working
4. nonwage benefits, subsidies, and income taxes

### Labor Market Equilibrium
Forecasting the effects of changing market conditions:
1. Is the labor supply or demand curve shifting?
2. Is the shift an increase or decrease?
3. How will wages and the number of jobs change in the new equilibrium?

---
## Wages, Workers, and Management

### Labor Demand
- employers try to deduce the **human capital** in potential workers
  - can include experience, personality, education, or skills
- they look at past achievements that might signal who is a smart and hard worker
- education as a signal:
  - conveys something that may be otherwise difficult to prove

### Game Theory and Designing Mechanisms
- mechanism design - considers how to implement system-wide solutions to game theory problems; designing optimal outcomes
- **efficiency wage** - provide an incentive to keep working hard (a bonus, or producitivity quota)
- "superstar effect" - why do some people make so much more than others?
  - premium paid for the best of the best
  - social network effects - attracting talent with talent

---
## Market Structure and Market Power

### Monopoly, Oligopoly, and Monopolistic Competition
- **market power** - how much a seller can charge without losing many sales to competing businesses
- market structure is important because it shapes market power
- types of market structure:
  - **perfect competition**
    - all businesses in an industry sell an identical good
    - many sellers and buyers where each is small relative to the size of the market
    - sellers have no market power
  - **monopology** - only one seller, which has a lot of market power
  - **oligopoly** - a handful of large sellers, which have some market power
  - **monopolistic competition** - many small businesses compete, each selling differentiated products
    - **product differentiation** - efforts by sellers to make their products different from those of their competitors
    - these sellers have some market power

#### Market Structure Determines Market Power
- least market power - perfect competition
- most market power - monopoly
- both of these are rare
- **imperfect competition** - facing at least some competitors and/or selling products that differ a little from those competitors

### Insights into Imperfect Competition
1. market power allows you to pursue independent pricing strategies
2. having more competitors leads to less market power
3. successful product differentiation gives you more market power
4. imperfect competition among buyers give them bargaining-power
5. your best choice depends on the actions that other businesses make

### Setting Prices to Maximize PRofit
- *trade-off* between price and quantity (selling more vs making more money per item)
- use **firm demand curve** and **marginal revenue curve** to evaluate the trade-off
  - **firm demand curve** - quantity that buyers demand form an individual firm as it changes its price
  - market demand is the quantity demanded from all firms
  - firm demand depends on the type of competition faced

#### Marginal Revenue Curve
The addition to total revenue from selling one more unit
- lies below the demand curve and declines faster
- reflects the output effect minus the discount effect
  - **ouput effect** (P) - revenue increase from selling one more unit
  - **discount effect** (ΔP x Q) - revenue loss from cutting the price on all the units sold
- marginal revenue = P - (ΔP x Q)

### The Problem with Market Power
- sellers can exploit their market power

### Market Power vs. Perfect Competition
1. market power leads to higher prices
2. market power leads to inefficiently smaller quantity
3. market power yields larger economic profits
4. businesses with market power can survive even with inefficiently high costs

### Increasing Competition can Lead to Better Outcomes
- causes lower prices and higher quantity
- market power -> businesses produce lower quantity and sell at higher price (*underproduction* problem); problematic for buyers but benefit for sellers
- smaller quantity is not the best for society
- patents provide incentive to engage in research

### Public Policy to Restrain Market Power
Governments regulate markets through two sets of laws that do the following:
- ensuring competition thrives
- minimizing harmful ways businesses might exploit their market power

### Laws to Encourage Competition
- anti-collusion laws prevent businesses from agreeing not to compete
  - **collusion** - an agreement to limit competition
- merger laws prevent businesses from combining to consolidate market power
- some laws thwart abuses of market power: monopolizing vs. being a monopoly
- international trade fosters competition

### Mergers
- a competitive merger creates a more fearsome competitor
  - bad for rivals
  - could be good for consumers
- an anti-competitive merger reduces competition for all sellers
  - good rivals
  - bad for consumers

### Minimizing the Harm from Exercising Market Power
- implementing price ceilings
  - eliminates discount effect and underproduction problem
  - perfectly competitive - reduces economic surplus
  - inperfectly competitive markets - increase economic surplus
- laws that link prices to costs
  - eliminate the incentive to prduce high-quality goods
  - reduce incentives for managers to keep down costs

### Natural Monopoly
A market in which it's cheapest for a single business to service the market
- society's best interest: price = marginal cost
- however, price < average cost; suppliers stay in business only by offering prices that are too high
Solution:
- government provides goods
- set prive = marginal cost, and tax revenues pay for losses
