## The Core Principles of Economics
- **cost-benefit** (either/or) - pursue only those choices whose benefits are at least as large as their costs
  - *economic surplus* - total benefit - cost flowing from a decision; measure of how much your decision has improved your well-being
  - *framing effects* - can lead you astray and make identical choices seem different
- **opportunity cost** (or what) - the true cost of something is the next best alternative you must give up to get it (comparing trade-offs); not necessarily financial costs
  - *scarcity* - fundamental economic problem of limited resources
  - *sunk costs* - exists whether you make your choice or not
  - *production possibilities frontier (PPF)* - visualize opportunity cost (producing inside PPF is inefficient, producing outside requires some other change)
- **marginal** (one more) - decisions about quantities are best made incrementally
  - *marginal benefit/cost* - the benefit/cost from one unit
  - *rational rule* - if something is worth doing, keep doing it until your marginal benefits equals your marginal costs (maximizes economic surplus)
- **interdependence** (what else) - your choice depends on a lot of things
  1. your choices - dependencies between each of your individual choices
  2. others' choices - dependencies between people or businesses in the same market
  3. other markets - dependencies between markets
  4. future choices - dependencies through time

## Demand

### Individual Demand Curve
- plotting the quantity of an item that someone plans to buy at each price
  - scatter plot, not a curve
  - x and y are flipped
- at the given price, how many should I buy?
- holds other things constant (first, consider only one variable)
- **law of demand** - the cheaper something is, the more people with buy it (downward sloping curve)

### Your Decisions and Your Demand Curve
- **Rational Rule for Buyers** - buy more of an item if its marginal benefit is greater than the cost
- the demand curve is also the marginal benefit curve
- **diminishing marginal benefit** - each additional item yields a smaller marginal benefit than the previous item (the reason behind the law of demand)
- individual demand reflects marginal benefits

### Market Demand: What the Market Wants
- **market demand curve** - sum of the quantity demanded by the entire item
- also obeys the law of demand
- price changes quantity demanded for both new and old customers
  - if prices are low, # of customers increases, and old customers may buy more

#### Steps to Estimating
1. survey customers
2. add up the total quantity demanded by customers at each price
3. scale up quantities so they represent the whole market
4. plot the total quantity demanded at each price

### What Shifts Demand Curves
- shift in the demand curve - movement of the curve
- increase in demand - shift to the right
- decrease in demand - shift to the left

#### Factors That Change Both Individual and Market Curves
1. income
   - **normal good** - good for which higher income causes and increase in demand
   - **inferior good** - good for which higher income causes a decrease in demand
2. preferences
   - companies using advertising
   - social pressure
   - fashion trends
3. prices of related goods
   - **complementary goods** - goods that go together (e.g hot dogs and hot dog buns)
   - **substitute goods** - goods that replace each other
     - demand will increase if the price of a substitute good rises
4. expectations
   - if you think prices will rise, you will make your purchase today, increase today's demand
   - if you believe prices will fall, you will delay your purchase, decreasing today's demand
5. congestion and network effects
   - **network effect** - when a good becomes more useful because other people use it (e.g. social media platforms)
   - **congestion effect** - when a good becomes less valuable because other people use it (e.g. roads)

#### Factors That Only Change Market Demand
1. the type and number of buyers
   - if the composition of the market changes, market demand will also change
   - market demand increases over time as the population grows

### Shifts vs Movements Along Demand Curves
- price change - movement
- other factors - shift

## Supply

### Individual Supply Curve
- the quantity of an item that a business plans to sell at each price
- selling plans; holds all other things constant
- **law of supply** - upward sloping, unlike demand (the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied)

### Perfectly Competitive Markets
- all firms in the industry sell an identical good
- many buyers and sellers, small relative to the size of the market
- **price-taker** - an actor who charges the market price; actions do not affect the market price

### Choosing the Best Quantity to Supply
- use MCOI
- MC - produce one more unit if marginal benefit > marginal cost
- O - when determining marginal cost, compare production cost to the next best option: not producing (produce or don't produce?)
  - marginal cost includes variable costs, but not fixed costs
- **variable costs** - costs that vary with the quantity of output (e.g labor, raw materials)
- **fixed costs** - incurred regarless of level of output
- I - best choice depends on a bunch of other choices, but for now hold constant (perfectly competitive market)

### Rational Rule for Sellers in Competitive Markets
Sell one more item if the price is >= the marginal cost
- to maximize profit, keep applying the rule and product until price = marginal cost

### Supply Curve
- supply curve = marginal cost curve
- upward sloping because of increasing marginal costs
- as you produce more, the marginal cost of producing an extra unit rises
  - **diminishing marginal product** - the marginal product of an input declines as you use more of that input (leads to rising marginal costs)
  - rising input costs also lead to rising marginal costs

### Market Supply Curve
Total quantity of an item supplied by the entire market at each price
- slopes upward (follows law of supply)
  - higher price: individual businesses supply a larger quanitty, and more bussinesses are supplying their goods and services
  - lower price: fewer businesses are doing so
- movement along the supply curve: price change or change in quantity

### Market Supply Curve Shifts
- **increase/decrease in supply** - shift to the right/left
- *interdependence principle* - sellers choices depend on many other factors than price

#### Shifts Both Individual and Market Curve:
1. input prices
   - **interdependence** - choices of other businesses affect your decisions
2. productivity and technology
   - **productivity growth** - when businesses figure out how to produce more output with fewer input
   - often driven by **technological change**
3. prices of related outputs
   - **substitutes-in-production** - alternative uses of your production capacity (e.g. producing orange popsicles in the summer, and orange juice in the winter)
   - **complements-in-production** - goods that are made together (e.g. leather and beef)
4. expectations
   - decisions are linked through time

#### Shifts Only the Market Supply Curve:
1. type and number of sellers
   - any factor that changes expected future profits will change the number of suppliers in the market
   - if new business enter, supply increases; if businesses shut down, supply decreases

### Shifts vs. Movement
- price changes = movement
- other factors = shift

### Demand vs. Supply
Category | Demand | Supply
--- | --- | ---
Objective | maximize economic surplus (benefit - price) | maximize profit (revenue - cost)
To decide on quantity | Rational Rule for Buyers:<br>buy one ore if marginal benefit >= price | Rational Rule for Sellers:<br>sell one more if price >= marginal cost
Graph | demand curve = marginal benefit curve | supply curve = marginal cost curve
Curve Slopes | downwards because of diminishing marginal benefit | upwards because of increasing marginal cost
Rise in prices causes | reduction in quantity demanded | raise in quantity supplied
Fall in price causes | raise in quantity demanded | reduction in quantity supplied
Causes of Shifts | - income<br>- preferences<br>- prices of substitutes / complements<br>- expectations<br>- congestion / network effects<br>- type and # of consumers (market only) | - input prices<br>- productivity and technology<br>- prices of substitues and complements (in production)<br>- expectations<br>- tpye and # of sellers (market only)

## Equilibrium: Where Supply Meets Demand

### Markets
- any setting that brings together potential buyers and sellers
- they determine:
  - what gets produced
  - how much
  - who produces it
  - who receives it
  - at what price
- outcomes determined based on both *supply* and *demand*

### Market Equilibrium
- quantity supplied = quantity demanded
- at equilibrium, suppliers and demanders have no incentive to change
- at any price higher than equilibrium price (quantity > demand) there is a **surplus**
- at any price below the equilibrium price (quantity < demand), there is a **shortage**

### Predicting Market Outcomes
1. Is it the supply or demand curve shifting?
2. Is it and increase or decrease (right or left shift)?
3. How will prices and quantities change in the new equilibrium?

When both supply and demand shift, effects on price and quantity will depend.

## Elasticity: Measuring Responsiveness
Measure of how much quantities demanded and supplied respond to changing market conditions

### Price Elasticity of Demand
A measure of how responsive buyers are to price changes
- determines by how much demand will fall when prices rise
- = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price
- by what percent quantity demanded changes in response to a 1% price change (the slope of the demand curve)
- this value is negative  (to follow the law of demand)
- use the absolute value

### How Businesses Use Demand Elasticity
- **total revenue** - total amount received from buyers; price * quantity
- elastic demand - higher price yields less revenue
- inelastic demand - higher price yields more revenue

### Other Demand Elasticities
- **cross-price elasticity of demand** - how responsive the demand of one good is to price changes of another
  - % change in quantity demanded / % change in price of another good
  - percentage change in demand following a 1% price rise in another good
  - positive for substitutes
  - negative for complements
- **income elasticity of demand** - how responsive demand is to changes in income
  - % change in quantity demanded / % change in income
  - positive for normal goods
  - negative for inferior goods

### Price Elasticity of Supply
How responsive sellers are to price changes
- % change in quantity supplied / % change in price
- positive bc of the law of supply
- depends on how flexible your business can be

#### Determinants
The price elasticity of supply is larger in the following circumstances:
1. for firms that store inventories
2. when inputs are easily available
3. for firms w/ extra capacity
4. when firms can easily enter and exit the market
5. when there's more time to adjust

#### Calculating
- use midpoints as the sum for change
