## Instruction Set Architecture
Focus on the CPU

### Simple Machine Model
```
processor ----- memory
            |
            --- devices
```
We focus on the processor

### Arithmetic / Logic Expressions
`c = a + b` -> `add c, a, b`  
The operands are in memory -> memory addressing mode 

But trips to memory are expensive, so we store things in registers.

### Register Operands
Load/store instructions -> operands in registers -> register addressing mode
```
ld r1, a
ld r2, b
```

### Compiling with Register Operands
```
ld r1, a
ld r2, b
add r3, r1, r2
st c, r3
```
This is done with 4 instructions instead of 1, but things will become more efficient when the variables need to be reused.  
In this example, doing all this is rather dumb.

### Structs
```
a : struct {
    int b;
    int c;
}
```

In memory:
```
   ___
a |_b_| 100
  |_c_| 104
```

#### How do you load `b` and `c` into registers?
Introduce another addressing mode: base + offset
```
ld r2, 0 // b
ld r3, 4 // c
```

### Operand Granularity
type | bits | size
--- | --- | ---
char | 8 | byte
short | 16 | half word
int | 32 | word
long | 32/64<br>depends on architecture |

### Operand Alignment
```c
char a;
char b[3];
```
```
 ______ ______ ______ _____
|_b[2]_|_b[1]_|_b[0]_|__a__|
  103    102    101    100
```
- packing operands into a single word to save space
- ISA may support `ld` and `st` with different precision

```c
char a;
int b;
```
In this case, packing doesn't help (space/time tradeoff)
```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|_b_|_b_|_b_|_a_| 100
|___|___|___|_b_| 104
```
Packing this way means you have to access memory twice to get b.  
The processor will have to pull two words, and then figure out a way to extract the int.

```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|___|___|___|_a_| 100
|_b_|_b_|_b_|_b_| 104
```
Therefore, here it is okay to waste space.

### Endianness
Overall, big vs. little is a wash.

#### Little Endian
Least significant byte (LSD) at word address.
```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|___|___|___|___| 100
|___|___|___|___| 104
 +3  +2  +1  +0
```

#### Big Endian
Most significant byte at word address.
```
     ___ ___ ___ ___
100 |___|___|___|___|
104 |___|___|___|___|
     +0  +1  +2  +3
```

### Accessing Array Operands
```c
int a[100];
```

Usually arrays are used with for loops to calculate the index.  
New addressing mode -> base + index.

```
     ______
100 |______| a[0]
104 |______| a[1]
108 |______| a[2]
    |   .  |
    |   .  |
    |___.__|
128 |______| a[7]
132 |______| a[8]
```
Using base + offset getting to a[8] requires the compiler to calculate the offset.  
With base + index, this is done in the registers???
```
rb = 100
ld r8, 32  # using base + offset
```

### Conditional Statement
#### If
```c
if <predicate> {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

- introduction of PC (PC-relative addressing mode)
- one new instruction: `beq r1, r2, offset`

#### Switch
```c
switch (k) {
  case 0:
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
  default:
}
```

- simulate via if/else
- use `k` at runtime to directly branch
- jump table (store addresses for each case)

##### Other needed embellishments
- indirect addressing mode (`j@r1`, `PC <- memory[r1]`)
- MIPS has SLT istruction for bounds checking

#### Loop
```c
for () {
  ...
}
```

Nothing new needed

### Compiling Function Calls
```c
int main() {

}
```

#### Caller
- state of caller
- pass parameters
- remember return address
- jump to procedure

#### Callee
- allocate space for local variables
- pass result to caller
- return to caller

### JAL - Jump and Link
Remembering return address and jumping to target procedure

`JAL rlink, rtarget`: `rlink <- PC`, `PC <- rtarget`

### Procedure Call Mechanisms
Savestate -> call (pass parameters) -> return (result) -> restore state

#### Who saves and restores the caller state?
split between caller and callee

#### Save Prior to Procedure Call
- save all the registers - use the stack 
- the stack is the communication procedure between the caller and the callee
- it is stored in memory, so nothing new needed (load/store instructions)

#### Passing Parameters / Returning Result
Pushing to the stack not always necessary if there are available registers

#### Overall
- use the stack sparingly

#### Software Convention
Register | Use
--- | ---
s0-s2 | caller
t0-t2 | temporary
a0-a2 | parameter passing
v0 | return value
ra | return address (rlink)
at | target address (rtarget)
sp | stack pointer

#### Stack Convention
- decrease and push
- increase and pop

Stack
| --- |
local variables
saved a registers
previous return address
additional return values
addition parameters
saved t registers

This is the activation record of currently executing procedure.  
On a call chain, there is an activation record for each function call.  
All of it is done by the compiler.

1. caller saves any registers t0-t3 on the stack (if theyre needed on return)
2. caller places the parameters in a0-a2 (using the stack for additional parameters if needed)
3. caller allocates space for any additional return values on the stack
4. caller saves previous return address currently in ra
5. caller executes JAL at, ra (no effect on the stack)
6. callee saves any of the registers so-s3 that it plans to use during its execution on the stack
7. callee allocates space for any local variables on the stack
8. prior to return, callee restores any saved s0-s3 registers from the stack
9. upon return, caller restores previous return address to ra
