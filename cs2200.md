## Instruction Set Architecture
Focus on the CPU

### Simple Machine Model
```
processor ----- memory
            |
            --- devices
```
We focus on the processor

### Arithmetic / Logic Expressions
`c = a + b` -> `add c, a, b`  
The operands are in memory -> memory addressing mode 

But trips to memory are expensive, so we store things in registers.

### Register Operands
Load/store instructions -> operands in registers -> register addressing mode
```
ld r1, a
ld r2, b
```

### Compiling with Register Operands
```
ld r1, a
ld r2, b
add r3, r1, r2
st c, r3
```
This is done with 4 instructions instead of 1, but things will become more efficient when the variables need to be reused.  
In this example, doing all this is rather dumb.

### Structs
```
a : struct {
    int b;
    int c;
}
```

In memory:
```
   ___
a |_b_| 100
  |_c_| 104
```

#### How do you load `b` and `c` into registers?
Introduce another addressing mode: base + offset
```
ld r2, 0 // b
ld r3, 4 // c
```

### Operand Granularity
type | bits | size
--- | --- | ---
char | 8 | byte
short | 16 | half word
int | 32 | word
long | 32/64<br>depends on architecture |

### Operand Alignment
```c
char a;
char b[3];
```
```
 ______ ______ ______ _____
|_b[2]_|_b[1]_|_b[0]_|__a__|
  103    102    101    100
```
- packing operands into a single word to save space
- ISA may support `ld` and `st` with different precision

```c
char a;
int b;
```
In this case, packing doesn't help (space/time tradeoff)
```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|_b_|_b_|_b_|_a_| 100
|___|___|___|_b_| 104
```
Packing this way means you have to access memory twice to get b.  
The processor will have to pull two words, and then figure out a way to extract the int.

```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|___|___|___|_a_| 100
|_b_|_b_|_b_|_b_| 104
```
Therefore, here it is okay to waste space.

### Endianness
Overall, big vs. little is a wash.

#### Little Endian
Least significant byte (LSD) at word address.
```
 ___ ___ ___ ___
|___|___|___|___| 100
|___|___|___|___| 104
 +3  +2  +1  +0
```

#### Big Endian
Most significant byte at word address.
```
     ___ ___ ___ ___
100 |___|___|___|___|
104 |___|___|___|___|
     +0  +1  +2  +3
```

### Accessing Array Operands
```c
int a[100];
```

Usually arrays are used with for loops to calculate the index.  
New addressing mode -> base + index.

```
     ______
100 |______| a[0]
104 |______| a[1]
108 |______| a[2]
    |   .  |
    |   .  |
    |___.__|
128 |______| a[7]
132 |______| a[8]
```
Using base + offset getting to a[8] requires the compiler to calculate the offset.  
With base + index, this is done in the registers???
```
rb = 100
ld r8, 32  # using base + offset
```
